# Table (DataFrame) Specification

**Feature IDs:** #2250-2260
**Category:** Stdlib
**Status:** Implemented

Table/DataFrame-like data structure for tabular data:
- Column-based storage with typed columns
- SQL-like operations (select, where, join)
- Aggregation and grouping
- Statistical operations

NOTE: All tests skipped because the imported module std.table has a parse error.
