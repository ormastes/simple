# SDN Parser Tests
#
# Tests for LL(2) recursive descent parser.
#
# Covers:
# - Primitive parsing (all value types)
# - Inline collections (short form with =)
# - Block collections (long form with :)
# - Tables (named with |fields|, typed with table{types})
# - Dict vs array block disambiguation (LL(2) lookahead)
# - Error handling
#
# SKIPPED: sdn.parser module not yet implemented.
# Also affected by BDD framework scoping bug.
