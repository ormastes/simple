# Fix If Val Pattern Specification

**Feature IDs:** Tooling-Refactor-FixIfValPattern
**Category:** Tooling
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

Unit tests for the fix_if_val_pattern migration tool. This refactoring normalizes
the handling of `val` declarations within `if` conditions and related control
flow constructs, ensuring consistent semantics and code style.

## Behavior

The migration handles:
- Proper scoping of `val` declarations in if conditions
- Consistent pattern application across if/elif/else chains
- Preservation of value semantics and control flow
- Guard clause optimization opportunities

## Implementation Notes

This refactoring improves code clarity by standardizing how `val` declarations
interact with conditional expressions in the Simple language.
