# Argument Parsing Specification

**Feature IDs:** #3120
**Category:** Tooling
**Status:** In Progress

Command-line argument parsing utilities for global flags, internal flags,
and language configuration. Provides structured parsing of CLI arguments
with support for flag values and option filtering.

*Migrated from: src/driver/src/cli/commands/arg_parsing.rs*

NOTE: All tests skipped because GlobalFlags__parse() is an unsupported
static method call in the bootstrap runtime.
