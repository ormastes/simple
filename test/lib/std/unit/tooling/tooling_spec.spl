# Multi-Language Tooling Specification

**Feature IDs:** #XXX
**Category:** Tooling
**Difficulty:** 4/5
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

Comprehensive tests for multi-language project tooling that supports building,
testing, and deploying projects containing Simple, Rust, Python, JavaScript,
TypeScript, Go, C, and C++ code. Includes project detection, incremental
compilation, dependency tracking, error aggregation, and deployment pipelines.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Multi-Language Support | Detection and compilation of multiple languages |
| Project Detection | Identifying language-specific manifest files |
| Incremental Compilation | Tracking changes and only recompiling modified files |
| Dependency Tracking | Building and analyzing dependency graphs |
| Error Aggregation | Collecting and normalizing errors from all languages |
| Test Runner | Configurable parallel test execution |
| Deployment Pipeline | Staged artifact deployment |

## Behavior

The multi-language tooling system provides:
- Project detection by language manifest files
- File change tracking via timestamps and hashes
- Circular dependency detection and topological sorting
- Unified error format normalization across languages
- Configurable parallel test execution
- Error grouping by source file
- Multi-stage deployment pipelines
- Support for debug and release compilation modes
