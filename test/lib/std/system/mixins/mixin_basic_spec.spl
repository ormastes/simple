# Basic Mixin Declaration and Application

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Language
**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Status:** Implemented

## Overview

Mixins are stateful traits — they inject fields and methods into classes
at definition time. Unlike traits (behavioral contracts for runtime dispatch),
mixins provide structural composition without inheritance.

## Syntax

```simple
mixin Timestamped:
    created_at: i64
    updated_at: i64

    fn age() -> i64:
        self.updated_at - self.created_at

class User:
    use Timestamped
    name: text
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mixin | Reusable bundle of fields and methods |
| Field injection | Mixin fields become class fields |
| Method injection | Mixin methods become class methods |
| Override | Class methods override mixin methods |

## Behavior

- Mixins inject fields into classes at definition time
- Mixins inject methods into classes (unless class defines same-named method)
- Multiple mixins can be applied to one class
- dyn Mixin is NOT supported (mixins are structural, not behavioral)
