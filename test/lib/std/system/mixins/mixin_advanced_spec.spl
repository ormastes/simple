# Advanced Mixin Features

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Language
**Difficulty:** 3/5
**Status:** Partial (basic mixins implemented, advanced features planned)

## Overview

Advanced mixin patterns including mixin inheritance, private fields,
default field values, static members, and conditional application.

## Behavior

- Mixins can require other mixins (transitive composition)
- Private mixin fields are not exposed to the composing class
- Default values can be provided and overridden
- Static fields/methods in mixins are shared

    ## Advanced Patterns

    Tests advanced mixin patterns. Some features are planned but
    not yet runtime-implemented, so they use placeholder assertions.
