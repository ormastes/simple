# Generic Mixins with Type Parameters

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Language
**Difficulty:** 4/5
**Status:** Planned (generic mixins not yet runtime-implemented)

## Overview

Support generic type parameters in mixins for reusable generic behavior.
Generic mixins allow parameterized field types and method signatures.

## Syntax (Planned)

```simple
mixin Container<T>:
    items: [T]

    fn add(item: T):
        self.items.push(item)
```
