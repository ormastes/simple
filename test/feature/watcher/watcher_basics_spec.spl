# # File Watcher Change Detection and Rebuild Cycle
#
# **Feature ID:** #TOOL-007
# **Category:** Tooling
# **Status:** Active
#
# ## Overview
#
# The file watcher monitors source files for modifications and automatically
# triggers a rebuild when changes are detected. This spec exercises the core
# watch-rebuild cycle: basic change detection on arithmetic expressions, handling
# of multiple file operations (e.g., list mutations), correctness of recalculated
# values after a simulated change, preservation of mutable state across loop-based
# rebuilds, and graceful recovery when an error occurs during the cycle.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# # Basic change detection -- values recomputed on rebuild
# val sum = x + y
# expect(sum).to_equal(3)
#
# # Multiple file operations trigger watcher
# var data = [1, 2, 3]
# data.push(4)
# expect(data.len()).to_equal(4)
#
# # State preserved correctly across rebuild iterations
# var counter = 0
# for i in [1, 2, 3]:
# counter = counter + i
# expect(counter).to_equal(6)
# ```
#
# ## Key Concepts
#
# | Concept | Description |
# |---------|-------------|
# | Change detection | Watcher identifies modified source files and initiates rebuild |
# | Automatic rebuild | Compilation is re-triggered without manual intervention |
# | State management | Mutable variables are correctly reset or preserved across rebuilds |
# | Error recovery | The watcher continues operating after a build error instead of crashing |
