# # Access Control with Visibility Modifiers
#
# **Feature ID:** #LANG-038
# **Category:** Language
# **Status:** Planned
#
# ## Overview
#
# Visibility modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) control which scopes may
# access a given struct field, class method, or module-level declaration. `public`
# members are accessible everywhere, `private` members only within the defining
# class or module, and `protected` members within the class and its submodules.
# This spec is a placeholder that will be expanded once the visibility modifier
# feature is implemented; planned tests will verify compile-time rejection of
# illegal access, correct scoping across module boundaries, and interaction with
# the existing MDSOC capsule visibility system.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# # Planned visibility modifier syntax (not yet implemented)
# class Account:
# private balance: i64
# public fn deposit(amount: i64):
# self.balance = self.balance + amount
# protected fn audit_log(msg: Str):
# print(msg)
# ```
#
# ## Key Concepts
#
# | Concept | Description |
# |---------|-------------|
# | `public` | Member is accessible from any scope |
# | `private` | Member is accessible only within its declaring class or module |
# | `protected` | Member is accessible within its class and submodules |
# | Compile-time enforcement | Illegal access should be rejected during compilation, not at runtime |

    # ## Visibility Modifier Support
    #
    # Verifies that visibility modifiers correctly restrict or allow
    # access to members from different scopes and modules.
