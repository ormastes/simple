# SMF note.sdn Instantiation Tracking

**Feature ID:** #GENERIC-002
**Category:** Compiler
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

Tests the note.sdn section in SMF (Simple Module Format) for tracking generic
instantiation metadata. This spec is a placeholder awaiting rewrite from Gherkin
DSL to standard describe/it syntax. The feature enables tracking which generic
types and functions have been instantiated during compilation.

## Syntax

```simple
# note.sdn records generic instantiations
# e.g., List<Int> instantiated at line 42
```

# TODO: Rewrite this test using standard describe/it syntax
# Gherkin feature/scenario/given/when/then syntax is not yet fully supported
# The parser has issues with metadata fields and complex Gherkin constructs
