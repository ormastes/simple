# # Union Type Declarations and Discrimination
#
# **Feature ID:** #LANG-034
# **Category:** Language
# **Status:** Planned
#
# ## Overview
#
# Union types allow a variable to hold a value of one of several specified types,
# written as `A | B`. At runtime the language provides type discrimination so that
# pattern matching or type-checking can narrow a union back to a concrete type.
# This spec is a placeholder that will be expanded once the union type feature
# lands; the planned coverage includes declaring union type annotations, assigning
# values of different member types, and narrowing via `match` with type-case arms.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# # Planned union type declaration (not yet implemented)
# val value: Int | Str = 42
#
# # Planned pattern-match narrowing
# match value:
# case Int(n): print("number: {n}")
# case Str(s): print("string: {s}")
# ```
#
# ## Key Concepts
#
# | Concept | Description |
# |---------|-------------|
# | Union type (`A \| B`) | A type that can hold a value belonging to any of its member types |
# | Type discrimination | Runtime mechanism to determine which member type a union value actually is |
# | Pattern narrowing | Using `match` with type-case arms to safely extract the concrete value |
# | Planned status | Feature is not yet implemented; spec contains a placeholder test only |
