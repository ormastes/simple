# # Pass Keyword Variants
#
# **Feature ID:** #SYNTAX-002
# **Category:** Language
# **Status:** Active
#
# ## Overview
#
# Tests the enhanced pass keyword with semantic distinctions: `pass_todo` for
# unimplemented code markers, `pass_do_nothing`/`pass_dn` for intentional no-ops,
# and `pass` for generic backward-compatible no-ops. All variants work as
# statements, function in control flow contexts, and accept optional descriptive
# message arguments.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# pass_todo("implement error handling")
# pass_do_nothing("intentional stub for interface")
# pass_dn
# pass
# ```
# Pass Variants Specification
#
# Tests the enhanced pass keyword with semantic distinctions:
# - pass_todo: Marks unimplemented code (TODO marker)
# - pass_do_nothing / pass_dn: Intentional no-op
# - pass: Generic no-op (backward compatible)
