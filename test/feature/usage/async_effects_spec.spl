# # Asynchronous Effects and Async/Await
#
# **Feature ID:** #RUNTIME-011
# **Category:** Runtime
# **Status:** In Progress
#
# ## Overview
#
# Asynchronous effects integrate Simple's effect system with async/await concurrency,
# allowing effectful computations to suspend and resume without blocking. This enables
# composable async pipelines where effects like logging, error handling, or I/O propagate
# through awaited call chains. This spec validates that async functions correctly carry
# and propagate effects across suspension points.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# # Async effect propagation (planned)
# async fn fetch_data(url: text) -> text with IO, Error:
# val response = await http_get(url)
# response.body
#
# val result = await fetch_data("https://example.com")
# ```
#
# ## Key Concepts
#
# | Concept | Description |
# |---------|-------------|
# | Async/Await | Syntax for non-blocking suspension and resumption of coroutines |
# | Effect Propagation | Effects declared on async functions carry through await boundaries |
# | Effect Handler | A construct that intercepts and processes effects from async computations |
# | Suspension Point | A location where an async function yields control until a result is ready |
