# # Scoped Context Blocks for Resource Management
#
# **Feature ID:** #LANG-040
# **Category:** Language
# **Status:** In Progress
#
# ## Overview
#
# Context blocks provide scoped execution environments that guarantee setup and teardown
# semantics, similar to Python's `with` statement or RAII in C++. They enable safe resource
# management by ensuring cleanup code runs regardless of how the block exits. This spec
# validates basic context execution, nested context support, variable scoping within
# contexts, and proper cleanup guarantees when exceptions occur.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# context "Basic context execution":
# it "executes code within context scope":
# skip
#
# context "Nested contexts":
# it "supports properly nested context blocks":
# skip
#
# context "Context variables":
# it "maintains context-scoped variables":
# skip
# ```
#
# ## Key Concepts
#
# | Concept | Description |
# |---------|-------------|
# | Context block | A scoped execution region with guaranteed setup/teardown |
# | Setup/teardown | Code that runs before and after the context body executes |
# | Nested contexts | Contexts within contexts, with proper ordering of cleanup |
# | Context variables | Variables whose lifetime is bound to the enclosing context scope |

describe "Context Blocks":
    # Tests for context blocks that provide scoped execution contexts.
    # Verifies setup/teardown behavior, proper nesting of contexts,
    # exception handling within contexts, and resource cleanup guarantees.
