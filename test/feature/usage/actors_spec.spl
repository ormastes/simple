# # Actor Model Concurrency
#
# **Feature ID:** #RUNTIME-010
# **Category:** Runtime
# **Status:** In Progress
#
# ## Overview
#
# The actor model provides a message-passing concurrency primitive where isolated actors
# communicate exclusively through asynchronous messages. Each actor encapsulates its own
# state and processes messages sequentially from a mailbox, eliminating shared-state races.
# This spec validates the actor creation, message dispatch, and concurrent execution
# semantics of Simple's actor system.
#
# ## Syntax
#
# ```simple
# # Actor message passing (planned)
# val counter = spawn CounterActor(initial: 0)
# counter.send(Increment(by: 1))
# val result = counter.ask(GetCount())
# ```
#
# ## Key Concepts
#
# | Concept | Description |
# |---------|-------------|
# | Actor | An isolated concurrent entity with private state and a mailbox |
# | Message Passing | Communication via asynchronous send/ask rather than shared memory |
# | Mailbox | A queue of incoming messages processed sequentially by the actor |
# | Spawn | Creating a new actor instance that runs concurrently |
