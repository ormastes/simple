# Simple Language Traits and Implementations - Test Specification

# @skip

**Status:** Implemented (uses existing coherence rules)
**Feature IDs:**
**Source:** traits.md
**Type:** Extracted Examples (Category B)

## Overview

This file contains executable test cases extracted from traits.md.
The original specification file remains as architectural reference documentation.

**Note:** This is a test extraction file. For complete specification text,
design rationale, and architecture, see doc/spec/traits.md

## Extracted Test Cases

36 test cases extracted covering:
- Core functionality examples
- Edge cases and validation
- Integration patterns
