**Source:** concurrency.md
**Type:** Extracted Examples (Category B)

## Overview

This file contains executable test cases extracted from concurrency.md.
The original specification file remains as architectural reference documentation.

**Note:** This is a test extraction file. For complete specification text,
design rationale, and architecture, see doc/spec/concurrency.md

## Extracted Test Cases

24 test cases extracted covering:
- Core functionality examples
- Edge cases and validation
- Integration patterns
