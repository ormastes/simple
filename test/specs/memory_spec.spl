**Source:** memory.md
**Type:** Extracted Examples (Category B)

## Overview

This file contains executable test cases extracted from memory.md.
The original specification file remains as architectural reference documentation.

**Note:** This is a test extraction file. For complete specification text,
design rationale, and architecture, see doc/spec/memory.md

## Extracted Test Cases

17 test cases extracted covering:
- Core functionality examples
- Edge cases and validation
- Integration patterns

# All tests skipped because memory/ownership syntax (new(&), new*, new+, &T, *T, -T, +T,
# handle_pool, actor, move closures, etc.) is not supported by the runtime parser.
