# @skip - async syntax not fully implemented
# @pending
# @Feature 708.1: Async/await support
# @Description: Test asynchronous programming features

# NOTE: describe, it, expect are built-in - no imports needed
# All tests skipped because async/await/spawn syntax is not supported by the runtime parser.
