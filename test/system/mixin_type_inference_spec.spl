# Type Inference in Mixins

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Language
**Difficulty:** 4/5
**Status:** Planned (type inference for generic mixins not yet implemented)

## Overview

Automatic type inference for generic mixins including field type inference,
method return type inference, and cross-mixin type unification.

    ## Type Inference Support

    Tests automatic type inference in generic mixins.
    These features are planned but not yet runtime-implemented.
