# mixin syntax issues (mixin, with, assert, pass keywords)
# All tests converted to skip_it stubs
"""
# Mixin Feature Specification

## Overview

Mixins provide a way to compose behavior into classes without using inheritance.
They support:
- Field and method composition
- Generic type parameters with inference
- Trait bounds and constraints
- Required methods that targets must implement
- Multiple mixin application

Features not supported by runtime parser:
- mixin keyword
- with keyword for mixin application
- assert keyword (use check() instead)
