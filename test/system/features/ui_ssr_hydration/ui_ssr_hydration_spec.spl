# UI SSR Hydration Specification

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Runtime
**Difficulty:** 4/5
**Status:** Planned

## Overview

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Hydration enables UI components rendered on the
server to become interactive on the client by attaching event handlers and
state management to existing DOM elements without re-rendering them.

## Syntax

```simple
val html = render_to_string(component)
hydrate(root_element, component)
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| SSR | Rendering UI components to HTML strings on the server |
| Hydration | Attaching interactivity to server-rendered markup |
| Partial Hydration | Selectively hydrating interactive islands |

## Behavior

- Preserves server-rendered DOM structure
- Attaches event listeners without re-rendering
- Validates client-server markup consistency
- Supports progressive and partial hydration strategies
