# UI Structural Patchset Specification

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Runtime
**Difficulty:** 4/5
**Status:** Planned

## Overview

UI Structural Patchsets enable efficient incremental updates to user interface
structures by computing and applying minimal change sets (patches) rather than
rebuilding entire UI trees. This supports virtual DOM-like patterns for
high-performance UI rendering.

## Syntax

```simple
val patch = diff(old_tree, new_tree)
apply_patch(root_element, patch)
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Diff | Algorithm to compute structural differences between trees |
| Patch | Minimal set of operations to transform one tree into another |
| Reconciliation | Process of applying patches to DOM/UI elements |

## Behavior

- Computes minimal edit distance between tree structures
- Supports insert, delete, update, and move operations
- Handles keyed and non-keyed children
- Batches DOM operations for performance
