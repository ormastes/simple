# Symbols and Atoms Specification

**Feature IDs:** #TBD
**Category:** Language
**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Status:** Planned

## Overview

Symbols (also called atoms) are immutable, interned identifiers that are
compared by identity rather than value. They provide efficient comparison
operations and are commonly used for keys, tags, and enum-like values.

## Syntax

```simple
val status = :ok
val error = :not_found

match result:
    :ok => handle_success()
    :error => handle_error()
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Symbol | Interned identifier compared by identity |
| Atom | Alternative name for symbol (Erlang terminology) |
| Interning | Process of storing unique string once |
| Symbol Table | Runtime storage for interned symbols |

## Behavior

- Symbols are prefixed with colon: `:name`
- Symbol comparison is O(1) pointer equality
- All occurrences of same symbol share memory
- Symbols are immutable and cannot be modified
