Reference Capabilities and Borrowing Specification

**Feature:** Borrowing and reference capabilities system
**Category:** Memory Management
**Status:** In Progress

Tests for the borrowing system including mutable (mut T), isolated (iso T),
and immutable reference capabilities. Verifies proper ownership transfer,
mutable access restrictions, and isolation guarantees.
