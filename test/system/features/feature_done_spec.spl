# Feature Completion Tracking Specification

**Feature IDs:** #FEATURE-DONE
**Category:** Infrastructure
**Status:** Implemented

This specification documents the living documentation pattern where features
remain verified through executable examples and behavior tests. It ensures that
completed features maintain their documented behavior and remain compilable
over time as the codebase evolves.

## Overview

The feature completion tracking system provides:
- Executable specifications that verify feature behavior
- Automatic testing against documented examples
- Living documentation that stays synchronized with actual behavior
- Regression detection through continuous verification

## Behavior

- Features marked as "done" must have executable tests
- Tests verify that documented examples still work
- Changes to the codebase are caught immediately if they break completed features
- Test failures indicate either: (1) incorrect changes, or (2) need to update documentation
