# Comparison Operations Specification
#
# Tests comparison and logical operators including equality, inequality,
# ordering comparisons, and boolean logic operators.

describe "Comparisons":
    # Tests for comparison operators and logical operations.
    # Verifies correct behavior of equality, ordering, and boolean logic.
    describe "equality":
        it "equal values are equal":
            expect 5 == 5
        it "unequal values are not equal":
            expect 5 != 6

    describe "less than":
        it "smaller is less":
            expect 3 < 5
        it "equal is not less":
            expect (not (5 < 5))

    describe "greater than":
        it "larger is greater":
            expect 5 > 3
        it "equal is not greater":
            expect (not (5 > 5))

    describe "less than or equal":
        it "smaller is less or equal":
            expect 3 <= 5
        it "equal is less or equal":
            expect 5 <= 5

    describe "greater than or equal":
        it "larger is greater or equal":
            expect 5 >= 3
        it "equal is greater or equal":
            expect 5 >= 5

    describe "logical operators":
        it "and requires both":
            expect (true and true)
        it "and fails if one false":
            expect (not (true and false))
        it "or requires one":
            expect (true or false)
        it "or fails if both false":
            expect (not (false or false))
