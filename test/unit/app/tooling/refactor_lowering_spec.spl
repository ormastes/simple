# # Refactor Lowering Specification
#
# **Feature IDs:** Tooling-Refactor-Lowering
# **Category:** Tooling
# **Status:** In Progress
#
# ## Overview
#
# Unit tests for the refactor_lowering migration tool. This refactoring pass
# normalizes and optimizes the HIR (High-level Intermediate Representation)
# lowering process, improving code generation and enabling better compiler
# optimizations.
#
# ## Behavior
#
# The migration handles:
# - Standardization of lowering patterns across different AST node types
# - Elimination of redundant lowering operations
# - Optimization of control flow in lowering phase
# - Better integration with downstream code generation passes
#
# ## Implementation Notes
#
# This is a compiler infrastructure refactoring that improves the efficiency
# and maintainability of the HIR lowering stage without changing visible
# language semantics.
