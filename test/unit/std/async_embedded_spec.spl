"""
Async Embedded Runtime Tests
Feature: Lightweight async runtime for embedded systems
Category: Runtime
Status: In Progress

Tests for the embedded async runtime including fixed-capacity
JoinSet, FuturesUnordered, and cooperative scheduler.

All tests skipped because async/await syntax and related types
(Poll, EmbeddedFuture, EmbeddedScheduler, etc.) are not supported
by the runtime parser.
