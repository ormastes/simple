# Basic Expressions Specification (Python-Inspired)

**Feature IDs:** #PYTHON-COMPAT-EXPR
**Category:** Expressions
**Status:** Planned

This specification tests basic expression syntax that Python developers
will find familiar. Simple adopts many Python-inspired expression patterns
including arithmetic operators, string operations, and boolean expressions.

## Covered Features

- Arithmetic expressions (+, -, *, /, %)
- String interpolation (Python f-string style)
- Boolean expressions (and, or, not)
- Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
- Variable assignment and references

    ## Python-Inspired Expression Syntax

    Tests for expression syntax familiar to Python developers.
    This suite verifies that Simple's expression handling matches
    Python's intuitive semantics while maintaining Simple's type safety.

    Key areas tested:
    - Integer and floating-point arithmetic
    - String concatenation and interpolation
    - Boolean logic and short-circuit evaluation
    - Comparison chaining and equality checks
