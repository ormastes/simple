# Phase 3: Mixin Basic Test
# Tests basic mixin definition and application

# Define a mixin with fields and methods
mixin Timestamped<T> {
    field created_at: i64
    field updated_at: i64
    
    fn get_age() -> i64 {
        # Simplified: would normally use current time
        self.updated_at - self.created_at
    }
}

# Apply mixin to a class
class Document {
    field title: str
    field content: str
    
    use Timestamped<Document>
    
    fn new(title: str, content: str) -> Document {
        Document {
            title: title,
            content: content,
            created_at: 0,
            updated_at: 0
        }
    }
}

fn main() -> i32 {
    let doc = Document::new("Test", "Content")
    # Should be able to call mixin method
    let age = doc.get_age()
    0
}
