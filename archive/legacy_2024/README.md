# Legacy Code Archive - 2024

This directory contains legacy code that has been archived as part of the folder reorganization (2025-12-31).

## Contents

### stdlib_old/
Previous location: `lib/std/`
The old standard library location before migration to `simple/std_lib/src/`.
Contains 85 .spl files that have been superseded by the new stdlib.

### test_old/
Previous location: `test/`
Legacy test files that have been replaced by tests in `simple/std_lib/test/`.

## Why Archived

These directories were marked for removal in CLAUDE.md but retained for historical reference.
The active code is now in:
- Standard library: `simple/std_lib/src/`
- Tests: `simple/std_lib/test/`

## Safe to Delete

This archive can be safely deleted if disk space is needed. The code is not used by the current build system.
