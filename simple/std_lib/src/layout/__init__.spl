# Layout Module - Code locality optimization for startup performance
#
# This module provides runtime markers for profiling and layout optimization.
# Use `mark()` to signal execution milestones that the profiler uses to
# determine which functions should be placed in which 4KB page groups.
#
# Example:
#   import std.layout
#
#   fn main():
#       app = init_everything()
#       first_frame(app)
#       std.layout.mark("ui.ready")
#       event_loop(app)

#[variant(any)]
mod layout
