# Lean Code Generation Module
# Generates Lean 4 code from Simple verification models.
#
# This module provides a complete pipeline for:
# - Translating Simple types to Lean structures and inductives
# - Converting Simple functions to Lean definitions
# - Generating verification theorems from contracts
# - Emitting memory safety verification code
# - Running Lean to check proofs
#
# ## Module Structure
#
# - naming.spl: Identifier conversion (snake_case -> PascalCase/camelCase)
# - types.spl: Type translation (class -> structure, enum -> inductive)
# - expressions.spl: Expression translation to Lean terms
# - contracts.spl: Contract to theorem conversion
# - functions.spl: Function definition generation
# - traits.spl: Trait/impl to class/instance conversion
# - emitter.spl: Low-level Lean syntax emission
# - codegen.spl: Main code generator orchestration
# - memory_safety.spl: Memory safety verification code generation
# - verification_checker.spl: Pre-codegen constraint checking
# - verification_diagnostics.spl: Error codes and diagnostics
# - runner.spl: Lean invocation and proof checking
