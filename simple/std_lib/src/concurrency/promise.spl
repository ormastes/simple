/**
Promise Type for Async-by-Default Semantics

Promise[T] represents a value that will be available in the future.
This is the return type of all async functions in the async-by-default model.

Key Concepts:
- `sync fn foo() -> T` returns T directly
- `fn bar() -> T` returns Promise[T] (async by default)
- Use `await` to extract T from Promise[T]

States:
- Pending: Computation not yet complete
- Resolved: Successfully completed with value
- Rejected: Failed with error

Basic Usage:
```sdoctest
>>> let p = Promise.resolved(42)
>>> await p
42
```

Creating Promises:
```sdoctest
>>> let p = Promise.new(\resolve, reject: resolve(100))
>>> await p
100
```

Chaining:
```sdoctest
>>> let p1 = Promise.resolved(10)
>>> let p2 = p1.then(\x: x * 2)
>>> await p2
20
```

Error Handling:
```sdoctest
>>> let p = Promise.rejected("error")
>>> try:
...     await p
... catch e:
...     "caught: " + e
'caught: error'
```
