# With Statement Feature Specification

# With Statement (Context Managers)

**Feature ID:** #51
**Category:** Control Flow
**Difficulty:** 2/5 (Beginner-Intermediate)
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

The `with` statement provides RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern support for safe
resource management. It ensures that cleanup code (`__exit__`) is always called, even if exceptions
occur in the body, preventing resource leaks.

**Design Philosophy:**
Simple follows Python's context manager protocol, enabling automatic resource cleanup for files,
locks, database connections, and other resources that require deterministic cleanup.

## Syntax

### Basic With Statement

```simple
with resource:
    # Use resource
    # __exit__ called automatically when block ends
```

### With Alias Binding

```simple
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    val content = file.read()
    # file.__exit__() called automatically
```

**Grammar:**
```
with_stmt = 'with' expression ('as' identifier)? ':' NEWLINE INDENT statement+ DEDENT
```

## Protocol

Context managers must implement two methods:

- `__enter__()` - Called before body, return value bound to alias
- `__exit__()` - Called after body (always, even on exception)

```simple
class FileHandle:
    handle: i32
    closed: bool

impl FileHandle:
    fn __enter__() -> FileHandle:
        # Open the file
        return self

    fn __exit__():
        # Close the file
        self.close()
```

## Runtime Representation

**Execution Flow:**
1. Evaluate resource expression
2. Call `__enter__()` on resource
3. If `as name` provided, bind result of `__enter__()` to name
4. Execute body block
5. **Always** call `__exit__()` on resource (even if exception occurred)
6. Remove name binding (if created)

**Error Handling:**
The `__exit__` method is called even if the body raises an exception, ensuring cleanup
always happens. This is critical for preventing resource leaks.

## Comparison with Other Languages

| Feature | Simple | Python | Ruby | JavaScript | Rust | Go |
|---------|--------|--------|------|------------|------|-----|
| Context managers | `with` | `with` | Block form | try-finally | RAII | `defer` |
| Auto-cleanup | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Manual | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Enter/exit protocol | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Exception safety | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Common Patterns

### File Handling

```simple
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    val content = file.read()
    process(content)
# file automatically closed here
```

### Lock Management

```simple
with mutex.lock() as guard:
    # Critical section
    shared_data.update()
# Lock automatically released
```

### Database Transactions

```simple
with db.transaction() as tx:
    tx.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?)", name)
    tx.execute("UPDATE stats SET count = count + 1")
# Auto-commit on success, rollback on exception
```

### Multiple Resources (Nested)

```simple
with open("input.txt", "r") as input:
    with open("output.txt", "w") as output:
        for line in input.lines():
            output.write(transform(line))
```

**AST:** `src/parser/src/ast/nodes/statements.rs:138-147` - WithStmt struct
**Interpreter:** `src/compiler/src/interpreter_control.rs:347-409` - exec_with()
**Tests:** `src/driver/tests/interpreter_control.rs` - With statement tests

## Related Features

- **Error Handling (#18):** Exception safety with with statements
- **Classes (#30):** Implementing __enter__/__exit__ methods
- **File I/O (#55):** File handles with automatic cleanup
- **Concurrency (#40):** Lock guards and mutex management

## Limitations and Future Work

**Current Limitations:**
- No `__exit__` exception argument (Python passes exception info)
- No multiple resources in single `with` statement

**Planned Features:**
- Multiple resources: `with open(a) as x, open(b) as y:`
- Exception info in `__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`
- Async with: `async with` for async context managers

    ## With Statement - RAII Pattern for Resource Management

    The with statement provides automatic resource cleanup through the context manager
    protocol. It guarantees that `__exit__` is called when leaving the block, regardless
    of how the block is exited (normal completion, return, or exception).

    **Key Properties:**
    - Resources are acquired at block entry via `__enter__`
    - Cleanup happens automatically via `__exit__`
    - Exception-safe: `__exit__` called even on errors
    - Optional alias binding with `as name`
