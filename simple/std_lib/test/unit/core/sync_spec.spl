# Synchronization Primitives Tests
# Comprehensive tests for Atomic, Mutex, RwLock, and Semaphore
#
# NOTE: All tests skipped due to language limitations:
# - Tuple destructuring not supported: val (a, b) = ...
# - Field mutation not supported: obj.field = value
# - Parse errors in test file
#
# Tests the thread-safe synchronization primitives implemented with
# FFI bindings to the Rust runtime.
