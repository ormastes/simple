# Context Manager Tests
# Tests for the ContextManager trait and built-in context managers
#
# SKIPPED: Multiple issues:
# 1. core.context module cannot be imported ('context' is reserved keyword)
# 2. Timer, Lock, TransactionContext classes not yet implemented
# 3. BDD framework scoping bug causes subsequent tests to fail
#
# See bug_report.md for details.
