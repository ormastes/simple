# Service Tests
#
# Service tests verify service boundaries with more corner cases than system tests.
# These tests run in-process and cover:
# - All interface classes within service boundary
# - All external library integration points
# - Edge values, error conditions, boundary conditions
# - Concurrent scenarios
#
# Characteristics:
# - In-process execution (faster than system tests)
# - HAL-only mocks allowed
# - More corner cases than system tests
#
# Run with: make test-service
