# TensorDimensionsConstraints — hand-written constraints and proofs for `TensorDimensions`

MANUAL-OWNED: `simple gen-lean` never writes this file. All hand-written
theorems for `TensorDimensions` live here; the generated model lives in
`TensorDimensions.lean` and may be replaced wholesale by regeneration.
