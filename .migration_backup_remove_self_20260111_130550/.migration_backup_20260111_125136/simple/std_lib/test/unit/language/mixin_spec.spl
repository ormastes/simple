# Mixin Feature Specification

Mixins provide a way to compose behavior into classes without using inheritance.
They support fields, methods, generic parameters, and type-safe composition.

## Features

- **Field composition**: Add fields from mixins to classes
- **Method composition**: Add methods from mixins to classes  
- **Generic mixins**: Parameterize mixins with type variables
- **Multiple mixins**: Apply multiple mixins to a single class
- **Type safety**: Full type checking and inference for mixin usage

## Syntax

```simple
mixin MixinName<T>:
    field_name: Type
    
    fn method_name(param: T) -> ReturnType:
        # implementation

class ClassName:
    use MixinName<ConcreteType>
    # class body
```

## Examples

Basic mixin with timestamp fields:

```simple
mixin Timestamp:
    var created_at: i64
    var updated_at: i64

class User:
    use Timestamp
    var name: String
```

Generic mixin for logging:

```simple
mixin Logger<T>:
    var log_level: i32
    
    fn log(message: T):
        print(message)

class Service:
    use Logger<String>
```

Multiple mixins composition:

```simple
class Document:
    use Timestamp
    use Logger<String>
    var content: String
```
