/**
Simple Concurrency Module

Provides primitives for concurrent and asynchronous programming:
- Generators: Lazy sequences with yield/next
- Futures: Async values with future/await
- Actors: Message-passing concurrency with spawn/send/recv
- Async Functions: Effect-safe async/await

```sdoctest
>>> val gen = generator(\: yield 42)
>>> next(gen)
42
```

```sdoctest
>>> val f = future(1 + 2)
>>> await f
3
```
