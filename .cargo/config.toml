# Cargo configuration for Simple compiler
#
# This file enables build-std for minimal binary size optimization.
# Requires nightly Rust toolchain.

[unstable]
# Build standard library from source with size optimizations
build-std = ["std", "panic_abort"]
# Note: panic_immediate_abort can cause issues with some nightly versions
# build-std-features = ["panic_immediate_abort"]

# Note: This configuration is used for minimal bootstrap builds.
# For regular builds, you can use stable Rust without this file.
