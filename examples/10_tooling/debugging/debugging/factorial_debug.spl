# Factorial Example - Demonstrates Debugging
#
# Try these debugging scenarios:
# 1. Set breakpoint on line 13 (inside factorial function)
# 2. Run with F5
# 3. Use Step Into (F11) to follow recursion
# 4. Inspect variables: n, result
# 5. View call stack to see recursive calls

fn factorial(n: i64) -> i64:
    # Set breakpoint here to see each recursive call
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        val result = n * factorial(n - 1)
        return result  # Inspect 'result' value here

fn main():
    print "Factorial Calculator"
    print "===================="

    # Try different values
    val numbers = [5, 10, 15]

    for num in numbers:
        # Set breakpoint here to inspect loop iteration
        val result = factorial(num)
        print "factorial({num}) = {result}"

    # Demonstrate variable inspection
    val x = 42
    val y = x * 2
    val z = y + 10  # Set breakpoint here, inspect x, y, z

    print "\nDebugging complete!"
