# Detail design: SimpleOS filesystem toolchain and servers

## Loader flow

1. Canonicalize and open the requested mounted path.
2. Read/validate ELF header and bounded program-header table.
3. For each `PT_LOAD`, validate offsets/sizes, allocate pages, zero BSS, and
   read file-backed bytes directly into mapped frames in bounded chunks.
4. Build argv/env/auxv, enter ring 3, and report the real exit status.

## Image flow

- Build target-native static Clang and Simple payloads.
- Size FAT/initramfs from payload totals plus filesystem overhead.
- Write the validated bytes to all canonical paths and record the target build
  stamp in `/SYS/SIMPLETOOL.SDN`.
- Reject text, marker, empty, unstamped, wrong-entry, host-target, or missing
  payloads before staging.

## Server flow

- HTTP scenario: boot, send `GET /health` and `GET /`, assert status/body.
- DB scenario: use the same boot HTTP listener, send three `POST /db` requests,
  and require create, insert, and the selected known value in one boot.

## Error handling

Every build/boot/check wrapper returns nonzero for missing media, stale build
stamp, target mismatch, short reads, malformed ELF/query, timeout, guest fault,
unexpected preload use, or missing response.
