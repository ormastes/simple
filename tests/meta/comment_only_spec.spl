# Comment-Only Specification Test

**Purpose:** Test if Simple compiler supports pure-docstring .spl files without executable code.

## Expected Behavior

This file should:
1. Parse successfully (docstrings are valid syntax)
2. Compile without errors
3. Generate no executable output (no tests/functions)

## Use Case

Specification files in tests/*_spec.spl may contain only documentation without tests,
serving as executable specifications that can be verified for syntax but don't
necessarily contain runnable test code.

## Status

If this file compiles without errors, comment-only _spec.spl files are supported.
If it fails, parser changes are needed to allow pure-docstring files.
