# 00_syntax_basics.spl - Basic syntax: indentation blocks, if/else, functions

# Simple function with if/else
fn sign_desc(x):
    if x > 0:
        return "positive"
    else:
        return "non-positive"

# Direct assignment without let
result = sign_desc(3)
print "sign_desc(3) = {result}"

# Direct expression evaluation
print "sign_desc(0) = {sign_desc(0)}"

# Function with type inference
fn double(x):
    x * 2

number = 21
doubled = double(number)
print "double({number}) = {doubled}"

# Exit with computed value
main = doubled
