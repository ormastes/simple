# HIR Lowering - AST to HIR Transformation (Facade)
#
# This is a facade module that re-exports functionality from the hir_lowering/ subdirectory.
# The implementation has been split into focused modules:
#
# - hir_lowering/types.spl       - Type definitions, error handling, type lowering
# - hir_lowering/expressions.spl - Expression and pattern lowering
# - hir_lowering/statements.spl  - Statement lowering
# - hir_lowering/items.spl       - Item lowering (functions, classes, structs, enums, traits, impls)
#
# This facade pattern keeps imports stable while improving code organization.

# Import submodules
mod hir_lowering.types
mod hir_lowering.expressions
mod hir_lowering.statements
mod hir_lowering.items

# Re-export main types
use hir_lowering.types.{HirLowering, LoweringError, LoweringErrorKind}

export HirLowering, LoweringError, LoweringErrorKind
