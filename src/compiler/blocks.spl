# Block System - Module Entry Point
#
# Re-exports the blocks module from blocks/ subdirectory.
# The blocks module provides custom block definitions for the lexer.
#
# This wrapper allows imports like:
#   use compiler.blocks.{block_registry, init_blocks}
#
# Implementation is in blocks/ subdirectory:
#   - blocks/registry.spl - BlockRegistry and registration functions
#   - blocks/builtin.spl - Built-in block definitions (m{}, sh{}, etc.)
#   - blocks/definition.spl - BlockDefinition trait
#   - blocks/modes.spl - LexerMode and syntax features
#   - blocks/context.spl - Block parsing context
#   - blocks/value.spl - Block value types
#   - blocks/resolver.spl - Block resolution

# Re-export all public API from blocks.mod
export * from .blocks.mod

# Convenience re-exports for common imports
export BlockRegistry, block_registry, init_blocks from .blocks.registry
export BlockDefinition from .blocks.definition
export LexerMode, LexerConfig, SyntaxFeatures from .blocks.modes
export BlockContext, BlockError from .blocks.context
export BlockValue from .blocks.value
