# Entity Dimension - Stable IR Types
#
# The entity dimension contains the stable domain types of the compiler:
# IR data structures (tokens, AST, HIR, MIR, type system).
#
# Rules:
#   - Entity types can only import from other entity types or shared utilities
#   - Entity types MUST NOT import from compiler features or transforms
#
# Design: doc/research/compiler_mdsoc_design.md Section 2.1
