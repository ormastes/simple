# Semantics Module
#
# Shared semantic definitions for interpreter and codegen.
#
# This module provides a single source of truth for language semantics
# that must be consistent between the interpreter and compiled code.
#
# Motivation:
# Previously, the interpreter and codegen independently implemented:
# - Type coercion rules
# - Truthiness evaluation
# - Binary/unary operation semantics
# - Method dispatch logic
#
# This led to bitwise_not(2),600 lines of duplicated logic. This module unifies these
# definitions to ensure semantic consistency and reduce maintenance burden.
