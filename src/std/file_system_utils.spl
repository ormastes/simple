# File System Utilities (Facade)
#
# This file was refactored from 1,695 lines into 8 focused modules.
# See file_system/ directory for implementations.
#
# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# Categories:
# - Types: FileInfo, DirEntry, Permission, TempFile, FileWatcher
# - File Operations: create, read, write, append, delete, rename, copy, move
# - Directory Operations: create, list, delete, traverse, walk (recursive)
# - Path Operations: join, split, normalize, absolute, relative, basename, dirname
# - Metadata: size, modified time, permissions, file type checks
# - Permissions: read, write, execute for owner/group/others
# - Watch: File change detection (mock)
# - Utilities: Temporary files, glob patterns, tree operations, symlinks, disk usage
#
# All functions use Option/nil pattern for error handling (no try/catch).
# Pure Simple implementation with mock backends for demonstration.
