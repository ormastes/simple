# RSA Public-Key Cryptography Utilities Module (Facade)
#
# This file was refactored from 1,759 lines into 10 focused modules.
# See rsa/ directory for implementations.
#
# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# Categories:
# - types: BigInt data structures and basic arithmetic operations
# - modular: Modular exponentiation, GCD, modular inverse
# - random: Random number generation for cryptography
# - primality: Primality testing (Miller-Rabin) and prime generation
# - key_gen: RSA keypair generation and key operations
# - byte_conversion: Conversion between BigInt, bytes, hex, and text
# - padding: PKCS#1 v1.5 padding schemes for encryption and signing
# - encrypt: RSA encryption and decryption (raw and padded)
# - sign: RSA digital signature operations
# - utilities: Key encoding/decoding, performance estimation
