# Quadtree Spatial Partitioning Utilities
#
# This module has been refactored using the facade pattern.
# All functionality is now organized in subdirectories:
#   - types: Point, bounds, and node type definitions
#   - create: Quadtree creation and initialization
#   - insert: Insert and remove operations
#   - query: Range, radius, and nearest neighbor queries
#   - split: Node subdivision and quadrant operations
#   - utilities: Collision detection and helper functions
#
# Re-export all public APIs for backward compatibility
