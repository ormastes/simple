# Complex Number Utilities Module (Facade)
#
# This file was refactored from 850 lines into 5 focused modules.
# See complex/ directory for implementations.
#
# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# Categories:
# - types: Complex number creation, constants, component access
# - arithmetic: Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, magnitude, power)
# - trigonometric: Trig and hyperbolic functions (sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh)
# - exponential: Exponential, logarithm, and root functions (exp, log, sqrt, roots)
# - utilities: Conversions, predicates, advanced operations, math helpers

# Import all submodules
mod complex.types
mod complex.arithmetic
mod complex.trigonometric
mod complex.exponential
mod complex.utilities

# Re-export all public APIs for backward compatibility
