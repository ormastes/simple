# Concurrent Module
#
# Pure Simple wrappers around Rust runtime concurrency primitives.
# All FFI calls go through the pre-built runtime binary.
#
# Modules:
#   thread      - Thread spawning, joining, sleep, yield
#   channel     - Inter-thread message passing (MPMC)
#   mutex       - Mutual exclusion locks
#   rwlock      - Read-write locks
#   atomic      - Lock-free AtomicBool and AtomicInt
#   actor       - Lightweight actor-based concurrency
#   collections - Thread-safe HashMap, HashSet, BTreeMap, BTreeSet
#
# Usage:
#   use std.concurrent.thread
#   use std.concurrent.channel
#   use std.concurrent.mutex
#   use std.concurrent.rwlock
#   use std.concurrent.atomic
#   use std.concurrent.actor
#   use std.concurrent.collections
