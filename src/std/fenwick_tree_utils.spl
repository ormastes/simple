# Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) Utilities Module (Facade)

# This file was refactored from 1,792 lines into 6 focused modules.
# See fenwick_tree/ directory for implementations.

# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# Fenwick Tree (BIT) Properties:
# - Space-efficient tree for cumulative frequency tables
# - Point update: O(log n)
# - Prefix sum query: O(log n)
# - Range sum query: O(log n)
# - Memory: O(n) - half the space of segment trees
# - 1-indexed arrays (tree[0] unused)
#
# Advantages over Segment Trees:
# - Simpler implementation (fewer lines of code)
# - Better memory efficiency (~50% less space)
# - Better cache performance (sequential memory access)
# - Elegant bit manipulation operations
#
# Key Concept:
# tree[i] stores sum of elements in range determined by LSB (Least Significant Bit):
# - tree[1] = arr[1] (covers 1 element)
# - tree[2] = arr[1..2] (covers 2 elements)
# - tree[4] = arr[1..4] (covers 4 elements)
# - tree[8] = arr[1..8] (covers 8 elements)
#
# Bit Operations:
# - i & -i: Isolates rightmost set bit (LSB)
#   Example: 6 (110) & -6 (010) = 2 (010)
# - i + (i & -i): Move to parent in update path
# - i - (i & -i): Move to child in query path
#
# Categories:
# - types: Core data structures, bit manipulation, tree creation
# - update: Point update operations and value modifications
# - query: Prefix sum and point queries, binary search operations
# - range_ops: Range sum queries and range update operations
# - construction: Tree conversion, scaling, merging, transformations
# - utilities: Statistics, metrics, 2D trees, applications
