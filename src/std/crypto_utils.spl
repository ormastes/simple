# Cryptographic Hashing Utilities Module (Facade)
#
# This file was refactored from 1,677 lines into 7 focused modules.
# See crypto/ directory for implementations.
#
# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Use SHA-256 or SHA-512 for new applications
# - Use HMAC for message authentication
# - Use PBKDF2 with high iteration count (100,000+) for passwords
# - DO NOT use MD5 or SHA-1 for security-critical applications
# - Use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
#
# Pure Simple implementation - no FFI, no external dependencies
# All algorithms implemented from scratch following official specifications
#
# Categories:
# - types: Bit operations, byte/hex conversions, basic utilities
# - sha256: SHA-256 hash algorithm (recommended)
# - sha512: SHA-512 hash algorithm (recommended)
# - legacy_hash: SHA-1 and MD5 (DEPRECATED - legacy support only)
# - hmac: HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA512, HMAC-SHA1
# - pbkdf2: Password-based key derivation (PBKDF2-HMAC)
# - utilities: High-level APIs, password hashing, security utilities
