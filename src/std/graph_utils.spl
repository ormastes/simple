# Graph Data Structure and Algorithms Module (Facade)
#
# This file was refactored from 2,068 lines into 9 focused modules.
# See graph/ directory for implementations.
#
# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# Categories:
# - types: Graph data structures, constructors, conversions
# - traversal: DFS, BFS, topological sort
# - shortest_path: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
# - spanning_tree: Kruskal, Prim MST algorithms
# - flow: Maximum flow and minimum cut algorithms
# - matching: Bipartite matching algorithms
# - strongly_connected: SCCs, Kosaraju's algorithm
# - coloring: Graph coloring, chromatic number
# - utilities: Common operations, metrics, properties, transformations

# Import all submodules
