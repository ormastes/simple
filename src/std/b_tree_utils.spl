# B-Tree Utilities Module (Facade)
#
# This file was refactored from 1,847 lines into 8 focused modules.
# See b_tree/ directory for implementations.
#
# Backward compatible: All original imports still work.
#
# Comprehensive B-tree implementation for database-style operations.
# A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data
# and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
#
# B-tree Properties:
# 1. All leaves are at the same level
# 2. Each node (except root) has [t-1, 2t-1] keys where t is minimum degree
# 3. Each internal node has [t, 2t] children
# 4. Keys within a node are sorted in ascending order
# 5. All keys in left subtree < key < all keys in right subtree
#
# B-tree Parameters:
# - Minimum degree (t): Determines node capacity
#   - t=3: 2-5 keys per node (2-3-4 tree)
#   - t=10: 9-19 keys per node
#   - t=100: 99-199 keys per node (database-friendly)
#
# Time Complexity:
# - Search: O(log_t n)
# - Insert: O(log_t n)
# - Delete: O(log_t n)
# - Height: O(log_t n)
#
# Space Complexity: O(n)
#
# Use Cases:
# - Database indexes
# - File systems
# - Large datasets on disk
# - Range queries
#
# NOTE: Pure Simple implementation with tuple-based structures.
# No generics, no try/catch, no chained methods.
#
# Categories:
# - types: Node/tree creation, property accessors, capacity checks, list helpers
# - search: Key search in nodes and trees
# - split: Node splitting during insertion
# - insert: Key insertion operations
# - delete: Key deletion operations (borrow, merge, fill)
# - traverse: Inorder and level-order traversals
# - statistics: Min/max, size, height, validation
# - utilities: Range queries, bulk ops, set ops, advanced queries, visualization
