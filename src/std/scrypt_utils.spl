# Scrypt Password Hashing Utilities Module
#
# Comprehensive scrypt key derivation function implementation for password hashing
# and key derivation. Scrypt is a memory-hard key derivation function designed to
# be resistant to hardware brute-force attacks (ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs).

# This is a facade module that re-exports all functionality from the scrypt package
