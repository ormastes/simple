# Red-Black Tree Utilities Module
#
# A comprehensive implementation of Red-Black trees (self-balancing binary search trees)
# in Pure Simple with no external dependencies.
#
# Red-Black Tree Properties:
# 1. Every node is either red or black
# 2. The root is always black
# 3. All leaves (NIL) are black
# 4. If a node is red, both its children are black (no consecutive red nodes)
# 5. Every path from root to leaf contains the same number of black nodes
#
# These properties ensure O(log n) worst-case time for insert, delete, and search operations.
