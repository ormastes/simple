# Actors Module
#
# Actor model for concurrent programming.
# Provides isolated actors with message passing.
# Actors register named method handlers at spawn time; the runtime
# dispatches incoming messages by looking up method names in the
# handler table.
#
# Public API:
#   - use std.actors.actor.{ActorRef, spawn_actor, make_handlers, get_actor_runtime}

# All submodules are automatically available.
