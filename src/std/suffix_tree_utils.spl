# Suffix Tree Utils - Facade Module
#
# Comprehensive suffix tree data structure for advanced string matching
# Provides O(n) construction and O(m) pattern matching
#
# This is a facade module that re-exports all functionality from specialized submodules:
# - suffix_tree/types: Core data type definitions (structural tuples)
# - suffix_tree/build: Tree construction and suffix array operations
# - suffix_tree/search: Search and occurrence finding
# - suffix_tree/lcs: Longest common substring and LCP operations
# - suffix_tree/pattern: Pattern matching operations
# - suffix_tree/utilities: Helper functions for text and list operations
