# Date and Calendar Utilities - Facade
# Pure Simple implementation of date handling and calendar calculations
# No system dependencies - all calendar math is computed
#
# This is a facade module that re-exports functionality from specialized submodules.
# The implementation is organized into the following categories:
#
# - types: Date creation, validation, constants, and properties
# - parse: Date parsing from strings
# - format: Date formatting to strings
# - calculate: Date arithmetic, comparison, navigation, ranges, and advanced calendar calculations
# - timezone: Timezone handling (placeholder for future support)
# - utilities: Additional utility functions
#
# Date representation: (year, month, day) tuples as i64 values
# - year: any integer (supports historical and future dates)
# - month: 1-12 (January=1, December=12)
# - day: 1-31 (depending on month/year)
#
# Calendar system: Proleptic Gregorian calendar
# Epoch: January 1, 0001 (day 1)
# Day of week: Monday=1, Sunday=7 (ISO 8601)
#
# Examples:
#   val date = from_ymd(2025, 1, 15)
#   val next = add_days(date, 10)
#   val diff = difference_in_days(date, next)
#   val iso = to_iso8601(date)
#   val parsed = parse_iso8601("2025-01-15")
