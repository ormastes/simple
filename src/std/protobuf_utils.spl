# Protocol Buffers Wire Format Utilities
#
# This module has been refactored using the facade pattern.
# All functionality is now organized in subdirectories:
#   - types: Wire type constants and basic type definitions
#   - encode: Encoding functions for all protobuf types
#   - decode: Decoding functions for all protobuf types
#   - wire: Wire format operations and field handling
#   - message: Message-level encode/decode and field operations
#   - utilities: Helper functions and utilities
#
# Re-export all public APIs for backward compatibility
