# Definition Parser - Facade Module
#
# This file serves as the main entry point for all definition parsing.
# The actual implementation has been split into focused submodules:
#
# - def/helpers.spl    - Shared utilities (fields, spans, generics, where clauses)
# - def/struct.spl     - Struct definitions
# - def/class.spl      - Class, mixin, and actor definitions
# - def/enum.spl       - Enum and union definitions
# - def/trait.spl      - Trait definitions
# - def/impl.spl       - Impl blocks and interface bindings
# - def/function.spl   - Function definitions, literal functions, aliases
#
# This facade pattern keeps imports clean and maintains API compatibility
# with the rest of the codebase while organizing code into logical units.
