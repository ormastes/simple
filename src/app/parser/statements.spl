# Statement Parser - Facade Module
#
# This module serves as a facade for all statement parsing functionality.
# The actual implementations are organized into focused submodules in stmt/:
#
# - stmt/declarations.spl      - Variable, const, static, type, unit, extern declarations
# - stmt/control_flow.spl      - if, for, while, loop, match, context, with, defer
# - stmt/jumps.spl             - return, break, continue, pass, skip
# - stmt/contracts.spl         - Entry/exit contracts, assert, assume, admit
# - stmt/module_system.spl     - use, import, mod, export, auto import
# - stmt/aop.spl               - AOP advice, DI bindings, arch rules, mocks
# - stmt/bounds.spl            - Bounds blocks for @simd kernels
# - stmt/verification.spl      - Lean blocks, calc proofs, Gherkin BDD DSL
# - stmt/macros.spl            - Macro definitions and parsing
#
# This facade pattern improves code organization while maintaining a single
# import point for statement parsing functionality.
