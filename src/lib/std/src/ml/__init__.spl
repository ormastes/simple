# ML - Machine Learning Module
#
# Provides machine learning capabilities including PyTorch tensor operations,
# neural networks, training utilities, and experiment tracking.
#
# ## Modules
#
# **Core:**
# - `torch`: PyTorch tensor operations and neural networks (GPU-accelerated)
# - `engine`: Event-driven training engine (PyTorch Ignite-inspired)
# - `tracking`: Experiment tracking with metrics logging (W&B-inspired)
#
# **Torch Submodules:**
# - `torch.nn`: Neural network layers (Linear, Conv, RNN, Transformer)
# - `torch.optim`: Optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW) and LR schedulers
# - `torch.autograd`: Automatic differentiation
# - `torch.data`: Dataset and DataLoader utilities
# - `torch.cache`: Smart caching with memory-aware mmap
# - `torch.validation`: Runtime validation for training pipelines
#
# ## Requirements
# - PyTorch feature flag must be enabled for torch module
# - CUDA support optional but recommended for performance
#
# ## Example
# ```simple
# import ml.torch as torch
# import ml.engine.{Engine, State, Accuracy}
# import ml.tracking
#
# # Create training run with tracking
# with tracking.run(project="mnist", name="baseline") as run:
#     # Create engine with metrics
#     val trainer = Engine(train_step)
#     trainer.add_metric(Accuracy(), "accuracy")
#
#     # Training loop
#     trainer.run(train_loader, max_epochs=10)
#
#     # Log final metrics
#     run.log({"final_accuracy": trainer.state.metrics["accuracy"]}, step=10)
# ```
