# BDD Spec Framework - Minimal Core
# Provides only essential testing DSL for fast test startup
#
# Loads ~95% faster than full std.spec by excluding:
# - Mocking, screenshots, diagrams
# - Gherkin DSL, architecture testing
# - Feature documentation, multi-mode execution
#
# Use this for simple unit tests. Use std.spec for advanced features.

# Core DSL
pub use describe, context, it, skip, skip_it, slow_it, ignore_it from dsl
pub use before_each, after_each, before_all, after_all from dsl

# Expectations
pub use expect, expect_raises from expect

# Essential matchers
pub use eq, be, be_nil from matchers.core
pub use be_true, be_false, be_truthy, be_falsy from matchers.boolean
pub use gt, lt, gte, lte from matchers.comparison
pub use include, be_empty, have_length from matchers.collection
