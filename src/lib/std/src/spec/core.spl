# BDD Spec Framework - Minimal Core
# Provides only essential testing DSL for fast test startup
#
# This module contains the absolute minimum needed for basic BDD tests:
# - describe/context/it DSL
# - expect assertions
# - Basic matchers
#
# For advanced features (mocking, screenshots, diagrams, etc.), use full `std.spec`

# Core DSL functions
export describe, context, it, skip, skip_it, slow_it, ignore_it from dsl
export before_each, after_each, before_all, after_all from dsl

# Expectations
export expect, expect_raises from expect

# Essential matchers only
export eq, be, be_nil from matchers.core
export be_true, be_false, be_truthy, be_falsy from matchers.boolean
export gt, lt, gte, lte from matchers.comparison
export include, be_empty, have_length from matchers.collection
