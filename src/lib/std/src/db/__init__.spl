# Database Operations Module
#
# Provides atomic file operations, database persistence, and unified CRUD API:
#
# - Atomic operations: File locking, atomic reads/writes
# - Record types: TodoRecord, FeatureRecord, TaskRecord
# - Persistence: save_todo_db, load_todo_db, etc.
# - Unified API: DatabaseTodo, DatabaseFeature, DatabaseTask
# - Test utilities: TestRun, append_test_run
#
# Example:
#   val db = DatabaseTodo.create("/tmp/todos.sdn")
#   db.insert(TodoRecord(...))
#   db.save()
