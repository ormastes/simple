# UI Framework - Simple UI Component System
#
# This module provides a platform-agnostic UI framework for building
# terminal (TUI) and graphical (GUI) applications with a shared API.
#
# Architecture:
#   Element/Node types (shared) -> PatchSet (diff) -> Renderer (TUI/GUI)
#   Widget (builder pattern) -> WidgetNode -> Element tree
#
# Features:
#   - Shared Element/Node types for TUI and GUI
#   - Builder pattern widgets for composable UI
#   - Reactive state management
#   - Structural PatchSet with keyed diffing
#   - Platform-specific renderers (TUI first, GUI future)
#   - Theme system for consistent styling
