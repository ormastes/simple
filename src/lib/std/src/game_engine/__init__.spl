# Common Game Engine Abstraction Layer
#
# Engine-agnostic interfaces for game development
# Works with both Godot 4.3+ and Unreal Engine 5.4+
#
# Modules:
# - scene_node: Scene graph node abstraction
# - component: Component system abstraction
# - material: Material and shader abstraction
# - input: Input handling abstraction
# - audio: Audio system abstraction
# - assets: Asset loading abstraction
# - physics: Physics system abstraction
# - actor_model: Actor model for game logic
# - effects: Effect system for async safety

mod game_engine
