# Concurrent Module
#
# Concurrency primitives: threads, locks, channels, and actors.
# Provides safe concurrent programming abstractions.
#
# Features:
#   - Thread spawning and management
#   - Mutex and RwLock for synchronization
#   - Channels for message passing
#   - Actor model for concurrent computation
#   - Concurrent collections (lock-free data structures)
#
# Public API:
#   - use std.concurrent.thread.{Thread, spawn_thread}
#   - use std.concurrent.mutex.{Mutex}
#   - use std.concurrent.rwlock.{RwLock}
#   - use std.concurrent.channel.{Channel, Sender, Receiver}
#   - use std.concurrent.actor.{Actor, spawn_actor}
#
# Safety:
#   - All locks are scoped to prevent deadlocks
#   - Channels provide safe message passing
#   - Actors isolate mutable state

# All submodules are automatically available.
