# Shared Wrapper Types for lib/
#
# Single-field newtype wrappers that give semantic meaning to primitives.
# Used with suffixed literal grammar: 42_actor_id -> ActorId(value: 42)

# --- ID Types ---
class ActorId:
    value: i64

class MessageId:
    value: i64

class ProcessId:
    value: i64

class BinaryId:
    value: i64

class RefId:
    value: i64

# --- Size/Capacity Types ---
class ByteSize:
    value: i64

class Capacity:
    value: i64

# --- Count Types ---
class Count:
    value: i64

# --- Time Types ---
class Millis:
    value: i64

class Nanos:
    value: i64

class Timestamp:
    value: i64

# --- Numeric Measure Types ---
class Reductions:
    value: i64

class RefCount:
    value: i64

class Offset:
    value: i64

class Length:
    value: i64

# --- Boolean Semantic Types ---
class Enabled:
    value: bool

class Closed:
    value: bool
