# Fraction Utilities Module
# Provides rational number (fraction) arithmetic and operations
#
# Fractions are represented as tuples: (numerator, denominator)
# All operations maintain the invariant that denominator > 0
#
# Examples:
#   val half = from_int(1, 2)           # 1/2
#   val third = from_int(1, 3)          # 1/3
#   val sum = add(half, third)          # 5/6
#   val product = multiply(half, third) # 1/6
#   print to_string(sum)                # "5/6"
#
# Perfect for:
#   - Precise arithmetic without floating-point errors
#   - Music theory (note durations, intervals)
#   - Measurements and conversions
#   - Mathematical computations requiring exact ratios
