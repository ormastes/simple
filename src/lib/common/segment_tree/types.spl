# Segment Tree Type Definitions and Data Structures
#
# This module contains type definitions and data structure representations
# for segment trees.
#
# DATA TYPES:
# - SegmentTree: (tree: list, n: i64, type: text)
#   - tree: array storing segment tree nodes
#   - n: size of original array
#   - type: "sum", "min", "max", "gcd", etc.
#
# - LazySegmentTree: (tree: list, lazy: list, n: i64, type: text)
#   - tree: array storing segment tree nodes
#   - lazy: array storing pending updates
#   - n: size of original array
#   - type: operation type

# Get tree type
fn get_tree_type(tree_tuple: (list, i64, text)) -> text:
    return tree_tuple.2

# Get tree size (original array size)
fn get_array_size(tree_tuple: (list, i64, text)) -> i64:
    return tree_tuple.1

# Get internal tree array size
fn get_internal_size(tree_tuple: (list, i64, text)) -> i64:
    val tree = tree_tuple.0
    return tree.length()
