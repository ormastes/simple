# Dependency Tracker - Module resolution, visibility, and import graph

This module provides the dependency tracker implementation with Lean verification.
Handles module path resolution, visibility checking, macro imports, and dependency graphs.

## Components

- **resolution**: Module path resolution (4 Lean theorems)
- **visibility**: Visibility and export rules (7 Lean theorems)
- **macro_import**: Macro auto-import filtering (6 Lean theorems)
- **graph**: Import graph structure and algorithms

Total: 17 Lean theorems validated

## Quick Start

```simple
# Example 1: Resolve module path
use compiler_core.dependency.resolution.{resolve_path}

val path = resolve_path("std.string")
print "Resolved: {path}"
# Output: Resolved: /path/to/src/std/string.spl
```

```simple
# Example 2: Check visibility
use compiler_core.dependency.visibility.{is_visible}

val visible = is_visible("pub fn foo()", "external_module")
print "Visible: {visible}"
# Output: Visible: true
```

```simple
# Example 3: Build dependency graph
use compiler_core.dependency.graph.{build_graph, detect_cycles}

val graph = build_graph(["main.spl", "lib.spl"])
val cycles = detect_cycles(graph)
if cycles.len() > 0:
    print "Circular dependencies found"
```
