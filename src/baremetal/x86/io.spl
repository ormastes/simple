# x86 Port I/O
#
# Low-level port I/O instructions for x86 bare-metal programming.
# These are used to communicate with hardware devices via I/O ports.
#
# Note: These are stub implementations. Real implementation requires
# inline assembly support which is not yet available.

# Write a byte to an I/O port
fn outb(port: i32, value: i32):
    # Stub: actual implementation uses x86 OUT instruction
    # asm "out dx, al" with port in DX and value in AL
    pass

# Read a byte from an I/O port
fn inb(port: i32) -> i32:
    # Stub: actual implementation uses x86 IN instruction
    # asm "in al, dx" with port in DX, result in AL
    0

# Write a word (16-bit) to an I/O port
fn outw(port: i32, value: i32):
    # Stub: uses x86 OUT instruction with 16-bit operand
    pass

# Read a word (16-bit) from an I/O port
fn inw(port: i32) -> i32:
    # Stub: uses x86 IN instruction with 16-bit operand
    0

# Write a double word (32-bit) to an I/O port
fn outl(port: i32, value: i32):
    # Stub: uses x86 OUT instruction with 32-bit operand
    pass

# Read a double word (32-bit) from an I/O port
fn inl(port: i32) -> i32:
    # Stub: uses x86 IN instruction with 32-bit operand
    0

# I/O wait (short delay) by writing to unused port
# Port 0x80 is traditionally used for POST codes and causes a small delay
fn io_wait():
    outb(0x80, 0)
