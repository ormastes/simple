# Agent Tasks: SFFI v2 Hardening

**Status:** P0/P1 implementation handoff; P4+ planned

## Frozen before fan-out

The primary/highest-capability owner freezes `SffiFunctionContractV2`,
`ReturnOrigin`, return families, `ForeignRaw`, error codes, ABI encoding,
system-spec helper names, and manual step text from the detail design. No agent
creates a private duplicate.

| Lane | Scope | Sidecar | Acceptance owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| A0 | schema, diagnostics, golden encodings | Codex Spark for census only | merge owner |
| A1 | Rust seed return and interpreter extern semantics | Claude Haiku for fixture inventory | merge owner |
| A2 | self-hosted frontend/HIR/semantics | Codex Spark for reference search | merge owner |
| A3 | generator and C/C++/Rust wrapper shapes | Claude Sonnet draft review | merge owner |
| A5 | JIT/native/linker/SimpleOS P0 closure | Codex Spark for lane census | merge owner |
| A7 | reproduce-first, system scenarios, parity | Claude Haiku for matrix census | final reviewer |
| P4–P6 | evidence, migration, full performance | planned; no sidecar starts yet | separately assigned |

Sidecars may inventory and draft bounded slices. They may not approve exclusions,
manual quality, generated evidence, or done marks.

## Integration order

1. A0 interface freeze and golden vectors.
2. A1/A2/A3 in non-overlapping owner files.
3. A5 consumes the frozen registry and error contract.
4. A7 reruns only previously RED/changed shards, then one authoritative matrix.
5. Documentation/bug records update from measured evidence.

## Ownership and review

- **Merge owner:** `/root` (or an explicitly reassigned primary agent).
- **Final reviewer:** best available normal/highest-capability Codex, independent
  of lower-model sidecar drafts.
- **Docs owner:** `/root/docs_specs` for this artifact set only.
- **Concurrent-work rule:** each implementation agent uses a separate worktree,
  commits only owned files, and reports unrelated dirt without folding it in.

Maximum three verify/fix cycles per phase. A lane with unavailable tooling
records a fail-fast blocker; it does not substitute seed/static evidence or a
passing placeholder.
