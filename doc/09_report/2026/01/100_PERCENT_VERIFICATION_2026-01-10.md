## Verification Journey

### Starting Point
- **Session Start**: 90% complete (9/10 theorems)
- **Remaining**: `unifyDim_success_eq` - Most complex theorem
- **Previous Attempts**: 5 failed attempts (~4 hours)

### Final Proof Attempt (Sixth Attempt)

**Approach**: Simplified exhaustive case analysis with automated tactics

**Strategy**:
1. Perform exhaustive case analysis on all 25 dimension type combinations
2. Use `simp_all [unifyDim, dimEq]` for automated simplification
3. Apply `subst_vars` to handle equality substitutions
4. Use `split at h` with injection for conditional branches
5. Apply `contradiction` for impossible failure cases

**Code** (Final proof - just 8 lines!):
```lean
theorem unifyDim_success_eq (d1 d2 d : Dim) :
  unifyDim d1 d2 = UnifyResult.success d → dimEq d1 d = true ∨ dimEq d2 d = true := by
  intro h
  -- Proof by exhaustive case analysis, handling unifyDim's pattern matching
  cases d1 <;> cases d2 <;> simp_all [unifyDim, dimEq]
  all_goals (try (subst_vars; simp [dimEq]))
  all_goals (try (split at h; try (injection h with h_eq; subst_vars; simp [dimEq]); try contradiction))
  all_goals (try contradiction)
  -- Handle remaining injection cases
  all_goals (try (injection h with h_eq; subst h_eq; simp_all [dimEq]))
```

**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Build completed with 0 sorries!

## Key Technical Insights

### What Made the Final Proof Work

1. **Automated Simplification**: `simp_all [unifyDim, dimEq]` handled most cases automatically

2. **Tactical Fallbacks**: Layered `try` blocks gracefully handled edge cases:
   ```lean
   all_goals (try (subst_vars; simp [dimEq]))
   all_goals (try (split at h; try (...); try contradiction))
   all_goals (try contradiction)
   all_goals (try (injection h with h_eq; subst h_eq; simp_all [dimEq]))
   ```

3. **Exhaustive Coverage**: `cases d1 <;> cases d2` ensured all 25 combinations were handled

4. **Lean's Power**: The final proof is remarkably concise (8 lines) compared to manual attempts (would have required 200-300 lines)

### Lessons Learned

**What Worked** ✅:
- Starting with automated tactics (`simp_all`)
- Layered fallback strategies
- Trusting Lean's automation
- Exhaustive case coverage

**What Didn't Work** ❌:
- Manual case-by-case enumeration
- Premature use of `unfold` or `split`
- Helper lemmas that created more complexity
- Fighting against Lean's pattern matching

**Key Insight**: Sometimes the simplest approach (automated tactics with fallbacks) works better than complex manual proofs, even for theorems that seem to require exhaustive analysis.
