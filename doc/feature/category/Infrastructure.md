## Features

| ID | Feature | Description | Modes | Platforms | Spec |
|----|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|------|
| <a id="feature-1"></a>1 | Lexer | Tokenizes Simple language source code into a stream of tokens. Handles indentation-based syntax with INDENT/DEDENT tokens, string literals, numbers, identifiers, operators, and keywords. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/spec/lexer_parser.md](../../spec/lexer_parser.md#feature-1) |
| <a id="feature-2"></a>2 | Parser | Transforms token stream into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Uses recursive descent for statements and Pratt parsing for expressions with operator precedence. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/spec/lexer_parser.md](../../spec/lexer_parser.md#feature-2) |
| <a id="feature-3"></a>3 | AST | Abstract Syntax Tree for all Simple language constructs. Parses literals, expressions, statements, patterns, and type annotations into structured tree representation. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/spec/lexer_parser.md](../../spec/lexer_parser.md#feature-3) |
| <a id="feature-4"></a>4 | HIR | High-level IR for type checking and semantic analysis. Performs type inference, mutability checking, and capability verification after AST parsing. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/architecture/README.md](../../architecture/README.md#feature-4) |
| <a id="feature-5"></a>5 | MIR | Mid-level IR with 50+ instruction variants. Lowers HIR to basic blocks with explicit control flow. Handles arithmetic, memory, collections, patterns, async, and generators. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/codegen_technical.md](../../codegen_technical.md#feature-5) |
| <a id="feature-6"></a>6 | RuntimeValue | Tagged pointer value system with 64-bit encoding. Supports integers (61-bit), floats, booleans, nil, strings, arrays, dicts, and heap objects with type tagging. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/architecture/README.md](../../architecture/README.md#feature-6) |
| <a id="feature-7"></a>7 | GC | Automatic memory management with tracing garbage collection. Handles allocation, collection cycles, and safe deallocation of heap objects. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/architecture/README.md](../../architecture/README.md#feature-7) |
| <a id="feature-8"></a>8 | Package Manager | UV-style fast package management for Simple language. Supports simple.toml manifests, lock files, path/git dependencies, global cache, and dependency resolution. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/architecture/README.md](../../architecture/README.md#feature-8) |
| <a id="feature-9"></a>9 | SMF | Simple Module Format - binary executable format for compiled Simple programs. Supports sections, symbols, relocations, and memory mapping for efficient loading and execution. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/architecture/README.md](../../architecture/README.md#feature-9) |
