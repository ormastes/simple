| <a id="feature-12"></a>12 | Functions | First-class functions with lexical closure. Supports named functions, anonymous lambdas, default parameters, variadic arguments, and higher-order functions like map/filter/reduce. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/spec/functions.md](../../spec/functions.md#feature-12) |
| <a id="feature-14"></a>14 | Structs | Struct type for grouping related data. Supports typed fields, struct literals, and field access. | interpreter:supported, jit:supported, smf_cranelift:supported, smf_llvm:supported | - | [doc/spec/data_structures.md](../../spec/data_structures.md#feature-14) |
| <a id="feature-15"></a>15 | Variables | Variable declarations with let for immutable bindings and let mut for mutable bindings.
