## Test Patterns Established

### Unit Test Pattern
```simple
describe "Module":
    it "tests specific function":
        check(function() == expected)
```

### Branch Coverage Pattern
```simple
describe "Branch Coverage":
    it "if-then path":
        if condition: check(true)
        else: check(false)
    
    it "if-else path":
        if not condition: check(false)
        else: check(true)
```

### System Test Pattern
```simple
describe "System Integration":
    slow_it "complete workflow":
        val input = prepare()
        val result = execute_full_pipeline(input)
        check(result.success)
```

## Remaining for 100% Coverage

**Estimated Gaps**: 5% of branches

1. **Rare Error Conditions** (2%)
   - File I/O failures (disk full, permissions)
   - Network timeouts
   - Memory allocation failures

2. **Platform-Specific Code** (1%)
   - macOS-specific paths
   - FreeBSD-specific paths
   - Architecture-specific code

3. **Compiler Optimizations** (1%)
   - Dead code elimination edge cases
   - Constant folding corner cases
   - Inlining heuristics

4. **Complex Pattern Matching** (0.5%)
   - Deeply nested patterns
   - Rare type combinations

5. **Defensive Code** (0.5%)
   - Unreachable error handlers
   - Debug assertions
   - Future-proofing code

### Action Plan for 100%

2. Create 30-50 targeted tests for gaps
3. Add fault injection tests
4. Test on multiple platforms
5. Review and document intentional gaps
