# How I made programming language with llm

## Why I made another language
Strongly type langauge convinent make large program but usually verbose which is not needed.
Simple short script language usally not strongly type or slow.
Third part library often different by interfaces.
tensor is not first class type.
arithmetic expression is too verbose and difficult to read.

## how I made language.
first bootstrap langauge was rust.
