# Bug: f64 payloads zero out when flowing through deeply nested struct/enum returns

- **ID:** interp_f64_nested_struct_payload_zero_2026-06-14
- **Severity:** P1 (blocks numeric verification of the whole spreadsheet formula engine)
- **Discovered:** 2026-06-14, while hardening `src/app/office/sheets/formula.spl`
- **Status:** OPEN

## Summary

`f64` values are **correct in simple/direct code** but collapse to `0.0` once they
flow through several levels of nested function calls that return structs/enums
carrying the `f64` (e.g. `EvalResult { value: CellValue.NumberVal(f64) }`). The
spreadsheet formula evaluator is exactly this shape, so every numeric formula —
including the **pre-existing** `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MIN`, `MAX` — evaluates to `0`
through the affected backends. This is a toolchain defect, not a defect in the
formula logic.

## Evidence

Direct, shallow f64 works:

```
fn id(x: f64) -> f64: x        # id(3.0) > 2.5  -> true   (OK)
fn want_three() -> f64: 3.0    # want_three() > 2.5 -> true (OK)
add(2.0, 4.0).to_i64()         # -> 6  (correct value)
```

But:

- **f64 string interpolation** renders `0.0` even when the value is correct
  (`print("{id(3.0)}")` → `0.0`). Misleading for probes — branch on the value
  instead of printing it.
- **Some f64-literal comparisons misbehave**: `add(2.0,4.0) > 5.5` returned
  false though `add(2.0,4.0).to_i64()` is `6`.
- **Deeply nested return path zeros the payload**: extracting the `f64` out of
  `CellValue.NumberVal` after it traversed the recursive-descent evaluator
  yields `0.0`. `=SUM(1,2,3,4)` → `0` (pre-existing function), `=SQRT(16)` → `0`,
  every numeric formula → `0`.

## Per-backend behavior (probe: `evaluate_formula` over `app.office.sheets`)

| Backend | f64 formula result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/simple run` (interpreter) | `0` | payload zeroed through nesting |
| `bin/simple <file>.smf` (compiled, interp fallback) | `0` | same |
| test runner (compiled mode) | `0` | numeric examples fail; empty-result examples pass |
| `simple native-build` (clang/native) | **core dump** | crashes on the first `evaluate_formula` call; see recent "native-build codegen root cause" work |

The integer-safe display path (`evaluate_formula_display_text`, pure `i64`)
works for **literal** arithmetic (`=2+3` → `5`, `=10-4` → `6`) under
`bin/simple run`, but cell-reference resolution still routes through the `f64`
`CellValue.NumberVal` and zeros (`=A2+A3` with A2=10,A3=5 → `0`), and the test
runner's compiled mode returns empty for even literal arithmetic.

## Impact

- No available backend can verify the numeric correctness of the spreadsheet
  formula engine end-to-end. Only **termination/structural** behavior (e.g.
  circular-reference depth guard returning an empty display) is verifiable in
  the test runner.
- Likely affects any numeric-heavy module that carries `f64` through nested
  struct/enum returns (perf, ML, geometry) on the interpreter/runner path.

## Repro

1. Define `fn want_three() -> f64: 3.0`; `print("{want_three()}")` → `0.0`,
   but `if want_three() > 2.5: print("OK")` → `OK`.
2. `evaluate_formula("=SUM(1,2,3,4)", sheet)` then extract the `NumberVal` →
   `0` under `bin/simple run`.
3. `simple native-build --entry <probe>.spl` then run the binary → core dump on
   the first `evaluate_formula` call.

## Proposed investigation

- Inspect interpreter value boxing/unboxing for `f64` when it is a struct field
  or enum payload returned across call frames (suspect: `Value::F64` copy vs.
  reuse, or i64/f64 tag confusion in `rt_value_*` unboxing).
- Inspect f64 string interpolation (`to_string`/format) — separate but related
  defect that makes probes misleading.
- Triage the native-build codegen crash on f64 paths alongside the existing
  "native-build codegen root cause" lane.

## Workaround in use

`src/app/office/sheets/formula.spl` keeps a parallel integer-safe display path
(`evaluate_formula_display_text`) for UI surfaces; the spec
`test/01_unit/app/office/sheets/formula_harden_spec.spl` asserts only the
termination behavior that the runner can execute.
