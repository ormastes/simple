# Browser jail: seccomp is a deny-list and in-process browsers are unjailed

- **Date**: 2026-08-15
- **Status**: OPEN (tracked; out of scope of the 2026-08-15 engine-gate change)
- **Area**: runtime (C), app/browser, os/hosted
- **Research**: `doc/01_research/app/browser/browser_sandbox_model_research_2026-08-15.md`

## Problems

1. **seccomp deny-list**: `rt_browser_renderer_sandbox_enter`
   (`src/runtime/runtime_process.c:2384`) installs a seccomp-BPF filter whose
   default action is `SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW` (`:2372`) with a list of denied
   syscalls. Any syscall not on the list — including future kernel additions —
   is allowed. Standard browser practice is an ALLOW-list with default
   `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
2. **No namespaces / privilege drop**: the jail sets rlimits, `no_new_privs`,
   and Landlock, but does not unshare user/net/PID namespaces or drop uid, so
   a compromised renderer retains direct network reach unless every net
   syscall stays on the deny-list.
3. **In-process browsers bypass the jail**: only the hosted renderer worker
   (`src/os/hosted/hosted_browser_renderer_worker.spl:1249`, broker
   `hosted_browser_renderer_process.spl:1595`) enters the jail. The
   in-process browsers under `src/app/browser/**` and `src/os/apps/*browser*`
   evaluate page script in the host process with no OS confinement.

## Required fix (Phase 2 of the research doc)

- Convert the seccomp filter to an ALLOW-list with `KILL_PROCESS` default;
  enumerate the worker's actual syscall set (strace under the spec suite).
- Unshare user+net (+PID where possible) namespaces before entering the jail.
- Route the in-process browsers' page-script execution through the jailed
  renderer worker instead of the host process.

## Interim mitigation (landed 2026-08-15)

Engine-level capability gate: untrusted page script
(`JsRuntime.new_browser`) is denied `require("process"/"os"/…)` and
`process.exit/cwd/nextTick` at native dispatch —
`src/lib/{gc_async_mut,nogc_sync_mut}/js/engine/interpreter_native.spl`,
spec `test/01_unit/lib/js/js_native_confinement_spec.spl`.
