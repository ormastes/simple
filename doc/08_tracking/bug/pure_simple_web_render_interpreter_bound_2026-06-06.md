# Bug: pure_simple web render O(n²) — two distinct causes (one fixed)

**Date:** 2026-06-06  **Area:** `src/lib/gc_async_mut/gpu/browser_engine` (web render lane)
**Symptom:** the `pure_simple` web-render backend appears to "hang" at larger
resolutions. It is **not a crash and not a deadlock** — two independent O(n²) (in
canvas pixel count) bugs, one in each render path.

## Path A — heuristic surface (inline-style pages, corpus scenes) — FIXED

`SimpleWebHeuristicSurface.create` allocated the framebuffer with
`pixels = pixels.push(0u32)` in a `W*H` loop. Each push reassigns the array and,
without unique ownership, copies it — so buffer creation was O((W·H)²) and the
whole heuristic render O(n²).

**Fix (pure Simple, commit `9900d2de`):** `[0u32; width*height]` (O(n) array-repeat).
Verified: no-text page 320×240 **69s → 3s (~23×)**, linear scaling restored.
Bit-exact gate unchanged (`check-electron-simple-web-engine2d-bitmap-evidence.shs`,
`mismatch_count=0`) — identical output.

## Path B — layout renderer (real CSS pages, e.g. vanillastyle) — stale binary

`simple_web_html_layout_renderer` paints via `fb[i] = color` writes. The
**in-place array-write optimization** (`CowEnv::get_mut`, commit `2d4579a0`,
**2026-06-03**) makes those O(1); without it every write CoW-clones the whole
framebuffer → O(n²).

**The deployed binaries are stale (pre-fix):**

| binary | built | no-text 320×240 | vanillastyle 320×240 |
|--------|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `bin/simple` → `bin/release/.../simple` | 2026-06-01 | 67s | — |
| `src/.../target/release/simple` | 2026-06-02 | 70s | 192s |
| `src/.../target/gui/debug/simple` | 2026-06-05 | (path A) | **23s** (8×) |

So `bin/simple` (what users run) and the headless `release` binary predate the
in-place fix and clone on every pixel write. The fresh `gui/debug` binary (which
`macos-gui-run` uses) has the fix — which is why GUI windows rendered while
headless `bin/simple` crawled.

**Fix:** rebuild & **redeploy the release binary** so `bin/simple` includes the
in-place array-write optimization (already in source). No renderer change needed.
`scripts/bootstrap/bootstrap-from-scratch.sh --deploy`.

## Verify
- Path A: no-text page, 4× pixels ≈ 4× time (was ~16×). Done.
- Path B: after redeploy, re-time vanillastyle 320×240 via `bin/simple`; expect it
  to match the gui/debug binary (~20s, not ~190s). Keep the bit-exact gate green.
