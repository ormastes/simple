# Entry-closure freestanding cranelift codegen defects found chasing first desktop frame (2026-07-16/17)

All found on `native-build --entry-closure --target x86_64-unknown-none --backend cranelift --opt-level=aggressive`
building `gui_entry_desktop.spl`. Each verified by objdump disassembly of `build/os/_wk/desktop.elf`.

## C1. Module-global `val/var X = call()` initializers never emitted
- Binary evidence: `_browser_default_font_lock` (font_renderer.spl:127) had 15 code refs, ALL uses,
  zero init stores; no init function anywhere. Global stays nil -> first `Mutex.lock` derefs nil self
  (cr2=0x0) -> recoverable-fault storm per text draw -> heap exhaustion.
- Also hits `[]`-initialized array globals (e.g. the new `_engine2d_cpu_offscreen_pool` reads len 0 /
  loses pushes).
- Workaround shipped: `font_renderer_ensure_runtime_locks()` called from gui_entry_desktop before
  first font use; hosted paths still run normal initializers.

## C2. `if val x = opt:` binding returns nil on the hit path
- Disasm of accessor: hit path compiled to `xor rax,rax; ret` (returns nil) while the miss path
  correctly returned the freshly created value. Same-shape failures previously seen inside
  `FontRasterizer.load` (`if val candidate = selected:` -> candidate nil -> `candidate.sha256`
  cr2=0x0).
- Note `.?` is (by design) the existence predicate `rt_is_some` -> bool; not an unwrap.

## C3. Short-circuit `and` drops its left operand when RHS is a call
- `if not registered_only and renderer.try_load_runtime_ttf(font_path):` compiled with NO test of
  `registered_only`; the call executed unconditionally (disasm 0xacb4bc..0xacb4cd: jne on the
  registered.1 test falls straight into the try_load_runtime_ttf call).
- Workaround shipped: nested `if not registered_only:` / `if renderer.try_load_runtime_ttf(...)`.

## C4. Anonymous tuple returns: positional member reads swapped
- `_engine2d_draw_ir_render_commands -> (Engine2D, i32, i32, text)`: caller's `.1` read the real `.2`
  and vice versa (probe: loop rendered a rect, `isrect=1`, yet outcome read r=0 s=1). Made a fully
  rendered frame report rendered=0 -> WM executor rejected the frame -> black screen.
- Same class as the documented interpreter "anon-tuple-return garbage" landmine.
- Workaround shipped: `Engine2dDrawIrRenderOutcome` struct replaces the tuple in draw_ir_adv.spl.
- 2-tuple `( [u8], bool )` returns (`_registered_selected_font_bytes`) likely affected too (unverified).

## Also observed (not yet root-caused)
- ~2 nil elements inside `batch.commands` arrays reaching render (nil-receiver ud2 panics x6 each)
  before the tuple fix; defensive `if not command.?: skip` added in render_commands.
- Fault-recovery scheme (baremetal_stubs.c `_rich_fault_entry`) advances RIP by fixed 2 bytes with
  rax=3; any fault on an instruction of another length resumes mid-instruction -> garbage execution
  (source of the 32.5MB rt_string_concat allocations that exhausted the heap).
