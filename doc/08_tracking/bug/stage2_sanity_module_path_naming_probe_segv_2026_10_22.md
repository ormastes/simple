# Stage-2 sanity: stage2_module_path_naming probe SIGSEGVs the worker (2026-10-22)

Status: OPEN — blocks the full stage2 sanity battery; p2_add (the compile/run
admission probe) PASSES. Phase 3 + phase-2 validation proceed provisionally
from the hello-world gate per the parallel collection policy (descendants
unadmitted until this closes).

## Symptom

`candidate_frontend_smoke` p2_add, scv_prime and the mir-retention probe pass;
the `stage2_module_path_naming.spl` probe (and then hello-world-positional)
kills the native-build worker with SIGSEGV during the HIR phase:

```
[build] phase=hir ... current=compiler.bootstrap_admission.stage2_module_path_naming
[hir-cache] disabled reason=no-compiler-scope
[WARN] any-escape pass: 0 diagnostic(s)
/usr/bin/timeout: the monitored command dumped core
Segmentation fault
error: stage2 failed the positional pure-Simple Stage-3 route (status 139)
```

Reproduces with the stage2 candidate under the sanity-like env
(`SIMPLE_BOOTSTRAP` unset, `--runtime-bundle core-c-bootstrap
--entry-closure --entry src/compiler/bootstrap_admission/stage2_module_path_naming.spl`).

## Context

The fixture's own header documents a KNOWN unresolved lane defect it
exercises: cross-module plain calls do not link in the per-module one-binary
lane (bare vs qualified symbol spelling; fix NOT landed as of 2026-10-17).
The previous failure mode of this lane was a clean link error; on the current
release_phase3 tree the worker SEGSEGVs instead.

A sibling defect in the same area was fixed today and may share a root cause:
`state = self.live_aliases(state, ...)` in the NLL solver corrupted the array
argument in transit (deterministic garbage header at callee entry);
moving the callee to module scope as a free function
(`nll_live_aliases`, e10fbb8f766 / 4f41ac876d8) fixed that instance. The
method-call argument-passing miscompile family (see cce1cddae19, mir receiver
writeback) likely has more instances reachable through this fixture's shape.

## Next steps

1. Replay the failing probe's worker under gdb (extract argv via strace on
   the coordinator, run `simple run src/app/cli/native_build_worker.spl ...`
   directly) and symbolize — the binary carries function symbols.
2. Audit the HIR-phase call path the fixture exercises for the same
   `self.method(array_arg, ...)` shape and convert to module-scope free
   functions as a targeted workaround.
3. Land the actual codegen fix for the argument-corruption family.

## Update 2026-10-22 (evening): deterministic on pristine state; crash path isolated

- Reproduced with a COMPLETELY fresh sanity state (stage2-home/stage2-tmp
  wiped) on HEAD 7f9a8c802a3: the probe SEGV persists — it is not
  accumulated-state corruption.
- The sanity probe runs the HIR phase with `[hir-cache] disabled
  reason=no-compiler-scope` (frontend_parse_cache_scope()=="" — the SCV
  admitted-epoch probe context). Manual reproductions all ran WITH the cache
  scope and pass; forcing `SIMPLE_HIR_CACHE=0` (reason=off) also passes. The
  crash therefore lives in the no-compiler-scope HIR lowering path, only
  reachable under the sanity's scrubbed SCV-epoch environment.
- The bounded collector sets RLIMIT_CORE=0, so no core is available; under
  gdb the coordinator path does not crash (timing/layout heisenbug).
Next actionable step: instrument the no-scope HIR lowering path
(driver_hir_pipeline_lowering) with an env-gated progress trace, rebuild the
candidate, and rerun the wrapper sanity to see the last successful operation
before the fault.

## Update: trace bracket (SIMPLE_NSCOPE_HIR_TRACE, landed passthrough)

Instrumented `lower_retained_surface_module` (retained-enter/retained-lowered)
and `_driver_module_aliases_with_closure` (aliases-enter), with the env
surviving the sanity scrub via the wrapper's inline `bootstrap_stage_sanity`
passthrough (commit "debug(sanity): passthrough ...").

Result: for the passing p2_add probe all milestones fire (retained-enter →
retained-lowered → aliases-enter, across both sanity passes and shard
re-entries). For stage2_module_path_naming.spl NO milestone fires — not even
aliases-enter — so the SIGSEGV happens at or before entry source processing:
in the entry PARSE or the load/scan/module-name derivation stage, inside the
sanity's scrubbed SCV-epoch environment. The same candidate parses and
compiles this exact file successfully outside the sanity (multiple manual
runs, cold HOME, cache off, delegate env). The file itself is a verbatim
mirror of `src/compiler/00.common/module_path_naming.spl` (235 lines, kept in
sync by header rule; the real functions live there).

Next step: instrument the parse-shard / entry-scan path
(driver_source_pipeline_loading entry scan, parse_full_frontend_selected_v1)
with the same env-gated trace to bracket the exact operation; suspect an
env-dependent parse path (package-index cold route) interacting with this
file's multi-line `or` continuations / docstring content.
