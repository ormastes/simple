# Stage 3 self-host post-HIR segfault (2026-08-14)

## Reproducer

From a clean `origin/main` worktree, run:

```sh
scripts/bootstrap/bootstrap-from-scratch.sh --full-bootstrap --backend=cranelift --deploy --no-mcp --jobs=2
```

## Evidence

- The deployed `release/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/simple test --help` crashes in
  `rt_env_set` while setting `SIMPLE_TEST_DEPTH`; its value argument is the
  invalid address `0x11`.
- Bootstrap cycle 1 rejected the multiline condition in
  `typed_storage_view_producer.spl` at the newline after `dest.?` and then
  crashed rather than returning the parser diagnostic cleanly.
- Cycle 2 crashed in
  `CompileContext.error_count()` from `CompilerDriver.lower_and_check_impl`.
- Replacing those internal accessor calls with direct reads of the scalar
  owned by `CompileContext.add_error` advanced cycle 3 through the first three
  HIR modules with `error_count=0` and into backend field processing.
- Cycle 3 still ended with exit 139 later in Stage 3. The bounded build log is
  `build/bootstrap/logs/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage3-native-build.log`.

## Required follow-up

Capture the next post-HIR backtrace in a fresh lane, fix the pure-Simple owner,
and prove a provenance-verified Stage 3 compiler before resuming the RV64
Sv39/PID1/network/SSH/WM live gates. Do not substitute the Rust seed as test
authority and do not re-run the three exhausted cycles from this lane.
