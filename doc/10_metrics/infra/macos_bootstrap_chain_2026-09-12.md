# macOS bootstrap chain — runs 1–5 (2026-09-12, aarch64-apple-darwin)

Lane: `bootstrap-from-scratch.sh --stop-after-stage2 --full-bootstrap --mode=dynload
--jobs=half`, from a detached worktree. Evidence root per run:
`<worktree>/.simple/storage/build/bootstrap/`. Times UTC unless marked local.

| run | tip | stage reached | wall | failure class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | pre-#670 (+#670 patch) | Stage 2 sanity | 23m22s — seed 8m00s (12:49:38→12:57:37), stage2 build+sanity 15m23s (→13:13:00) | `native-capsule-receipt-invalid` — receipt line 4 (object size) held a heap address |
| 2 | `0e437dec9b1` | pre-Stage-2 refusal | 6m44s (13:15:45→13:22:29), all seed rebuild | `stale-evidence-output-root` |
| 3 | `1e99989ebe9` | Stage 2 env canonical-list gate | 25s (13:58:12→13:58:37), seed cached | wrapper precondition refusal — env allowlist drift (#674), fixed by #684 |
| 4 | `bd64f7eadd9` | post-Stage-2 authority comparator (native build COMPLETED) | 12m24s (13:59:51→14:12:15), admission ~39s, seed cached | comparator operand missing — admitted snapshot deleted mid-Stage-2, misreported as "changed" |
| 5 | `bd64f7eadd9` | **Stage 2 sanity** (admission + build + comparator all passed) | ~18m (23:19→23:37 local), incl. seed rebuild | `darwin-link-tool-unresolved` at the hello-world smoke link |

## Findings
**The receipt mismatch is cleared.** Runs 4 and 5 both built Stage 2 with the capsule receipt
comparing clean (#670/#677 worked). Only run 1 hit it; runs 2/3 were harness refusals.

**Run 4 was stale-evidence-root interference, not a compiler defect.** `status=2` is a
*missing operand*: `runtime-admitted.txt` passed the pre-Stage-2 check at
`bootstrap-from-scratch.sh:2897`, was gone by `:3013` with every other plain provenance
file, and only `stage2-home/` + the frozen `stage2-runtime-authority/` survived. Run 5
discriminated it — on a virgin root the snapshot survived Stage 2 and the comparator passed,
so the stage-2 child does **not** prune its own provenance and `SIMPLE_NATIVE_INCREMENTAL`
is exonerated; the deletion came from outside, on a root inherited from run 1.
**Rule: one fresh evidence root per run.** The comparator's "changed" wording misattributes
a missing operand and is worth fixing.

**Run 5's blocker, left undiagnosed on purpose.** Producer:
`src/compiler/70.backend/linker/_LinkerWrapper/native_linking.spl:809`
(`publish_darwin_link_tool_identity` → `darwin_resolve_link_tool`, `:798`), which falls back
to `/usr/bin/which <command>` and yields `""` on non-zero exit (`:269`/`:937` return the same
token as `Err`). On this host `which cc|clang|ld` all resolve and the stage-2 *build* child carries a full `PATH`; the *sanity smoke* child is launched separately and its env is recorded nowhere — the `*.bounded.env` files are bounded-process **log** metadata, not env
dumps. A PATH-starved child is the natural hypothesis but unproven; the next step is to make
that child's env observable, not to guess a fix.

## Resume / Stage 4
`SIMPLE_NATIVE_BUILD_THREADS=5 sh scripts/bootstrap/bootstrap-from-scratch.sh
--resume-stage3-from-admitted=<worktree>/.simple/storage/build/bootstrap` — run from the
worktree that produced the admission (the receipt binds to source). Stage 3 resume pins
`--threads 1` unless `SIMPLE_NATIVE_BUILD_THREADS` is set; `--jobs` is rejected. No resume was possible: no run reached an admitted Stage 2 compiler.

**Stage 4 is unreachable from a hand-run lane.** `--resume-stage4-from-admitted` requires a
scheduler lineage admission manifest (`SIMPLE_BOOTSTRAP_LINEAGE_ADMISSION` + `…_SHA256`,
re-verified via `bootstrap-scheduler-contract.shs`) **and** `--deploy` or
`SIMPLE_BOOTSTRAP_STAGE4_QUARANTINE=1` (the no-deploy authority). Without a scheduler lease
the manifest cannot be minted, so no Stage 4 CLI candidate exists to smoke-test.
