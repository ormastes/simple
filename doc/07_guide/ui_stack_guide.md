# UI Stack Guide — CLI, TUI, GUI on One Session

**Audience:** developers writing an app that targets SimpleOS *and/or*
host operating systems, and anyone picking between `ui.cli`, `ui.tui`,
`ui.render`, `ui.browser`, `ui.electron`, …

**TL;DR**

- One widget tree, one state machine, N backends.
- The shared entry point is `UISession` in `src/lib/common/ui/session.spl`.
- Every `src/app/ui.*` directory is a backend that consumes the same
  session and renders it somewhere (terminal, framebuffer, canvas, …).
- Apps import only `common.ui.*`. They do not know which backend is
  attached.

For the architecture diagram and the four drawing-layer variations
(SimpleOS / host OS / Chromium / Electron), see
[`doc/04_architecture/cross_platform_wm.md`](../04_architecture/cross_platform_wm.md)
and [`doc/03_plan/gui_drawing_layer_variations.md`](../03_plan/gui_drawing_layer_variations.md).

## 1. The model: UISession

`UISession` is the single shared-state container. Its contract, from
`src/lib/common/ui/session.spl`:

```
class UISession:
    state: UIState                    # current tree + focus
    store: WidgetStore                # stable widget identities
    viewport: Viewport                # size, scale, dpi
    changelog: ChangeLog              # retained diff log
    lifecycle: LifecycleRegistry      # mount/unmount hooks
    surfaces: SurfaceManager          # named surfaces (main, popover, …)
    profile_resolver: ProfileResolver # layout profiles per device
    profile_sets: [ProfileSetEntry]
    capability_policy: CapabilityPolicy?
```

> *"All state transitions flow through the session, enabling shared
> state across CLI, TUI, and GUI backends."*

Apps never read or write the compositor, framebuffer, or terminal. They
build a `UITree` via `common.ui.builder`, hand it to a session, and
observe events. A backend picks up the session and projects it.

The **diff loop** is the same for every backend:

```
app state  ──update──▶  UITree ──diff──▶  Patch[] ──apply──▶  Backend
     ▲                                                            │
     └──────────────── UIEvent ◀──────────────────────────────────┘
```

`common.ui.diff.diff_trees_with` produces patches; `common.ui.patch`
turns patches into backend-agnostic operations; `common.ui.event`
turns backend-native input (keystrokes, pointer events, DOM events)
into the shared `UIEvent` enum.

## 2. Backend inventory

Everything under `src/app/ui.*` is a UISession backend. Pick by where
the pixels (or characters) go.

| App | Renders to | When to pick it | State |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| `ui.none` | nothing (event queue only) | headless tests, pure logic runs | stable |
| `ui.test_api` | assertion API | unit tests that poke `UIEvent` | stable |
| `ui.render` | static PPM / text snapshot | golden-image tests, CI artifacts | stable |
| `ui.cli` | stdio + socket observer | scriptable CLI, MCP tools, shell output | stable |
| `ui.ipc` | unix socket / pipe | tool ↔ tool composition, JSON-RPC | stable |
| `ui.mcp` | MCP server | exposing the session to an LLM | stable |
| `ui.vscode` | LSP notifications | VS Code extension view | stable |
| `ui.tui` | termios + cells | interactive terminal UI | stable |
| `ui.tui_web` | browser-hosted TUI | debugging TUI over a webpage | experimental |
| `ui.browser` | HTMLCanvas in a browser | V3 drawing stack (pure Simple in browser) | experimental |
| `ui.web` | DOM via widget→HTML mapping | static-site export | experimental |
| `ui.electron` | Electron BrowserWindow | V4 drawing stack | advisory/dev-preview |
| `ui.tauri` | Tauri webview | alt-desktop shell | experimental |

Pure-Simple GUI — the V1 (SimpleOS baremetal) and V2 (hosted winit)
paths — do **not** live under `src/app/ui.*`. They go through the
compositor in `src/os/compositor/` and reuse the same session; see the
arch doc.

## 3. The backend contract

A backend implements the trait defined in `src/lib/common/ui/backend.spl`.
The mental model:

```
trait Backend:
    # Called once; backend binds to its host (stdio, terminal, surface, …)
    me start(session: UISession)

    # Apply a patch list to the backend's output
    me apply(patches: [Patch])

    # Non-blocking: return any input events the backend has queued
    me poll_events() -> [UIEvent]

    # Called once at shutdown
    me stop()
```

Concrete backends ship richer hooks (async event loops, capability
negotiation, DPI changes) — but any backend that honors `apply` +
`poll_events` participates in the diff loop.

`backend_factory.spl` chooses a backend at runtime based on
`SIMPLE_UI_BACKEND` / CLI flags. Apps should not name a backend
directly; they should accept whatever the factory returns.

## 4. CLI / TUI / GUI — what actually differs

| Aspect | CLI (`ui.cli`) | TUI (`ui.tui`) | GUI (compositor or browser) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Output unit | lines | cells | pixels |
| Layout engine | `common.ui.layout` (text flow) | `common.ui.layout_engine` (grid cells) | `common.ui.layout_engine` (flex/px) |
| Patch renderer | `ui.render` text snapshot / stdio | `screen.spl` cell buffer | `os.compositor` or `browser_backend` |
| Input source | line reader / socket | termios raw | PS/2, winit, DOM, IPC |
| Event pump | blocking read loop | `async_input.spl` | compositor loop or event-loop callback |
| Capabilities | `TEXT_ONLY` | `TEXT_ONLY \| COLOR` | `GRAPHICS \| POINTER \| HIDPI \| …` |

The widget tree, `UIEvent`, lifecycle hooks, state updates, and change
logs are **identical**. The only axis of variation is the projection of
`Patch[]` to an output and the translation of input to `UIEvent`.

### JavaScript-disabled web behavior

`ui.web`, `ui.browser`, and `ui.electron` currently use JavaScript as host
bridge code for DOM rendering, WebSocket transport, and Electron preload
integration. With JavaScript disabled, treat web output as static snapshot or
exported HTML only. Live taskbar/window manipulation, input forwarding, native
window commands, and patch application require the host bridge until a
non-JavaScript transport lands.

### Practical consequences

- If a feature works in `ui.render`, it works in `ui.tui` and the
  compositor. If it breaks in only one, the bug is in the backend, not
  the widget code.
- Tests should prefer `ui.none` / `ui.test_api` / `ui.render`. They are
  pure, fast, and portable.
- A backend that needs custom behavior (e.g. `ui.tui` fast-path for
  color output) exposes it through `common.ui.capability.Capability`,
  not by bypassing the session.

## 5. Capabilities and layout profiles

Two knobs let one widget tree adapt to many backends without branching
in app code:

- **Capabilities** (`common.ui.capability`, `capability_policy`).
  Declarative: `require_capability(Capability.POINTER)` inside a widget.
  Backends advertise their capabilities at `start`; the policy rejects
  widgets that require something unsupported.
- **Layout profiles** (`common.ui.profile`). A profile is
  `{orientation, dpi, size-class}`. The widget tree picks a profile via
  `compute_profile`; the backend picks the current size-class on every
  viewport change. Apps usually don't interact with this — the builder
  DSL bakes profiles into style tokens (`common.ui.design_tokens`,
  `common.ui.glass_tokens`, `ios_theme`, …).

## 6. Testing across backends

`src/app/wm_compare/` is the screenshot capture and compare harness for the WM
lanes, but its runtime CLI and source semantics have evolved beyond the old
single-example form. Use the dedicated guide for current commands, source labels,
and caveats:

- [tooling/wm_compare.md](tooling/wm_compare.md)

Every new widget or renderer that needs visual parity should still land with a
registered compare scene or an equivalent capture path.

## 7. Authoring checklist for a new backend

When a new renderer lands (e.g. a Fuchsia host, a terminal graphics
protocol, another webview), it needs:

1. `src/app/ui.<name>/backend.spl` — impl `Backend` trait.
2. `src/app/ui.<name>/__init__.spl` — module registration.
3. Input translation: map native events to `common.ui.event.UIEvent`.
4. Capability declaration: advertise at `start`.
5. A `wm_compare` scene registration that can run against this backend.
6. A row in the Platform Support Matrix
   ([arch doc](../04_architecture/cross_platform_wm.md#platform-support-matrix)).
7. A row in this guide's backend inventory (section 2 above).

If the new renderer is below the compositor (pure Simple on a novel
display), it's a `CompositorBackend` + `InputBackend` pair, not a
`ui.*` backend — see the arch doc.

## 8. What *not* to do

- **Don't** import `os.compositor.*`, `os.drivers.*`, or any `engine2d`
  module from app code. That ties an app to a specific drawing-layer
  variation and breaks wm_compare.
- **Don't** add a "cli mode" or "gui mode" flag that forks the widget
  tree. Use capabilities + profiles.
- **Don't** write to the terminal or framebuffer directly inside a
  widget. Emit patches; let the backend decide.
- **Don't** cache backend-specific state on `UISession`. Use
  `SurfaceManager` for per-surface state and `WidgetStore` for
  widget-local state.
