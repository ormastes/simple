## Implementation Approach

### Rust: Match-Based Expression Inference

```rust
impl TypeChecker {
    pub fn infer_expr(&mut self, expr: &Expr) -> Result<Type, TypeError> {
        match expr {
            Expr::Integer(_) => Ok(Type::Int),
            Expr::Float(_) => Ok(Type::Float),
            Expr::String(_) => Ok(Type::Str),
            Expr::Bool(_) => Ok(Type::Bool),
            Expr::Nil => Ok(Type::Nil),
            Expr::Identifier(name) => {
                // Strip @ prefix for FFI calls
                let lookup_name = name.strip_prefix('@').unwrap_or(name);
                self.env.get(lookup_name).cloned()
                    .ok_or_else(|| TypeError::Undefined(...))
            }
            Expr::MacroInvocation { name, args } => { ... }
            // ... more cases
        }
    }
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- Procedural style with explicit type checking
- Mutable state (`&mut self`)
- Environment lookup via `self.env.get()`
- FFI handling (@ prefix stripping)
- Macro validation before use

### Simple: Class-Based Type Unifier

```simple
enum Type:
    Int, Bool, Str, Float, Unit
    Var(id: i64)                          # Type variables
    Function(param_count: i64, return_id: i64)
    Generic(name: str, arg_count: i64)

class TypeUnifier:
    substitution: any    # Dict mapping type IDs to types
    next_var: i64        # Counter for fresh variables

impl TypeUnifier:
    static fn create() -> TypeUnifier:
        TypeUnifier(substitution: {}, next_var: 0)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Object-oriented style with class
- Substitution tracking in dictionary
- Fresh variable generation via counter
- Type representation as enum with structural variants

## Key Observations

### 1. Type Representation

**Rust:**
- Uses `Type` enum with rich variants
- Likely has TypeId indirection (registry-based)
- Supports complex types (traits, effects, generics)

**Simple:**
- Simpler `Type` enum (8 variants)
- Direct structural representation
- `Function` type simplified (param_count + return_id)
- `Generic` type simplified (name + arg_count)

### 2. Algorithm Implementation

**Both appear to use:**
- ✓ Hindley-Milner type inference
- ✓ Substitution-based approach
- ✓ Type variable generation

**Differences (need deeper analysis):**
- Rust: Procedural with mutable state
- Simple: Object-oriented with class-based unifier
- Rust: Environment-based lookup
- Simple: Substitution dictionary

### 3. Feature Coverage (Initial Scan)

| Feature | Rust | Simple v3 | Gap |
|---------|------|-----------|-----|
| Basic inference | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Unification | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Type variables | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Function types | ✓ | ✓ (simplified) | Detail level |
| Generic types | ✓ | ✓ (simplified) | Detail level |
| Effect system | ✓ | Partial? | Need to check |
| Macro types | ✓ | ? | Likely missing |
| Trait bounds | ✓ | ? | Likely missing |
| Dynamic dispatch | ✓ | ? | Likely missing |
| Mixin types | ✓ | ? | Likely missing |

### 4. Code Quality Indicators

**Rust:**
- ✓ 67,540 test lines (29:1 test:code ratio)
- ✓ Extensive test coverage (10+ test files)
- ✓ Production hardening
- ✓ Advanced features tested

**Simple:**
- ⚠ Test coverage unknown (need to find test files)
- ⚠ Multiple versions suggest evolution/experimentation
- ✓ Clean separation (v1/v2/v3/simple)
- ? Production readiness unclear

## Architectural Differences

### Rust: Multi-Module Production System

```
Compilation Pipeline:
Parser → AST
   ↓
HIR Lowering (type_resolver.rs, type_registration.rs)
   ↓
Type Checking (checker_*.rs)
   ↓
Monomorphization (analyzer.rs, rewriter.rs)
   ↓
Codegen
```

**Characteristics:**
- Separate phases with clear boundaries
- Type registry for TypeId management
- Advanced checkers for specialized features
- Integration with HIR lowering

### Simple: Standalone Library

```
Type Checker Module:
  - Type representation (enum Type)
  - TypeUnifier class
  - Inference functions
  - Substitution tracking
```

**Characteristics:**
- Self-contained module
- May be used in interpreter or compiler
- Less integration complexity
- Focused on core algorithm

## Preliminary Hypothesis

Based on initial file reading:

**Hypothesis 1: Algorithm Equivalence**
- Both likely implement Hindley-Milner with Robinson unification
- Structural differences (procedural vs OO) but same algorithm

**Hypothesis 2: Feature Disparity**
- Simple has core features (inference, unification, generics)
- Simple missing advanced features (effects, traits, macros)
- Gap is significant but not insurmountable

**Hypothesis 3: Performance Gap**
- Rust likely 10-50x faster (compiled vs interpreted)
- Simple may have algorithmic inefficiencies
- Bottlenecks likely in dict operations (substitution)

**Hypothesis 4: Test Coverage Gap**
- Rust: 67,540 test lines (comprehensive)
- Simple: Unknown, likely much smaller
- Gap is major risk for self-hosting

**Validation:** These hypotheses will be tested in Phases 1-4 of the analysis plan.
