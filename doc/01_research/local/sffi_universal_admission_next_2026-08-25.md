# SFFI universal admission: next local research checkpoint

**Date:** 2026-08-25  
**Tree:** `fbde06072d5`
**Scope:** owned `src/compiler`, `src/compiler_rust`, `src/lib`, `src/os`, and
SFFI audit tooling; vendor trees excluded.

## Verdict

Simple SFFI is **not globally safe, verified, or signed**. The repository has
useful fail-closed pieces, but no current evidence proves universal production
admission across interpreter, JIT, native, dynload, and SimpleOS.

Do not reuse the 2026-08-23 totals as current-tree statistics. They use an older
scanner and generous file-level unsafe attribution. Newer declaration and call
totals are also historical checkpoints with different units. The source call
census remains a lower bound until resolved-HIR inventory covers aliases,
re-exports, generated calls, methods, and indirect callables.

## Fresh source-ledger census

The repository-owned census tools were run once on this tree. These are
source-ledger measurements, not resolved-HIR ABI proof:

| Unit | Total | Unsafe tagged | Signed/admitted | Untouched |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `rt_*` declaration rows | 12,128 | 951 | 0 | 10,907 |
| distinct `rt_*` symbols | 3,173 | 695 | 0 | 2,246 |

Distinct `rt_*` provider-language provenance is 1,321 linked-native symbols
whose implementation language is unknown, 1,012 with no provider observed,
591 Rust symbols, and 249 C/C++ symbols.

The separate raw-call authority census found 21,757 call sites across 3,131
caller files and 3,297 called symbols. Only 1,754 sites were inside lexical
`unsafe(ffi)` and 509 inside function-level FFI authority; 19,494 lacked
explicit authority. Its ratchet failed (`19,494 > 19,412`). This scanner is a
bounded source heuristic and explicitly does not resolve aliases, re-exports,
or generated declarations; resolved HIR remains the required final authority.

### 2026-08-25 post-admission refresh

After the exact-artifact signature and typed-boolean work landed, the full
repository-owned inventory was rerun once. The distinct `rt_*` symbol total and
provider-language split were unchanged, while declaration tagging advanced:

| Unit | Total | Unsafe tagged | Signed/admitted | Untouched |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `rt_*` declaration rows | 12,131 | 958 | 0 | 10,901 |
| distinct `rt_*` symbols | 3,173 | 696 | 0 | 2,246 |

Distinct provider-language provenance remains 1,321 linked-native/unknown,
1,012 with no provider observed, 591 Rust, and 249 C/C++. This proves that the
tree is still not universally admitted. It also exposed 26 duplicate Simple
`rt_mkdir_p` declarations whose legacy C and canonical pointer/length provider
shapes were not one authoritative ABI. The follow-up consolidation removed all
Simple declarations and routes callers through `std.io_runtime.mkdir_p` and
its already-scoped `rt_dir_create_all` owner. The focused lint now rejects any
reintroduction. This changes neither asymptotic work nor allocation count; it
removes a duplicate boundary and an unconditional LLVM declaration.

After the subsequent sleep and current-directory consolidations, one final
full inventory run for this checkpoint reported:

| Unit | Total | Unsafe tagged | Signed/admitted | Untouched |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `rt_*` declaration rows | 12,070 | 963 | 0 | 10,835 |
| distinct `rt_*` symbols | 3,171 | 697 | 0 | 2,243 |

The distinct provider split is now 1,319 linked-native/unknown, 1,012 with no
provider observed, 591 Rust, and 249 C/C++. `rt_sleep_ms` no longer has a raw
Simple declaration: callers use the existing scoped `rt_thread_sleep` owner.
`rt_env_cwd` now has one hosted declaration with the truthful `text?` contract;
the total wrapper maps provider failure to `"."` and replaces the former
`pwd` subprocess. The four bootstrap-library mirrors also declare `text?` and
place calls inside lexical `unsafe(ffi)` scopes. Zero production symbols are
cryptographically admitted, so global safety and verification remain false.

## Current enforcement boundary

- Normal and bootstrap MIR lowering now reject non-unit fallthrough with
  `E-SFFI-016`; the bootstrap change remains behaviorally unverified.
- Typed HIR identifies direct named extern calls and the safety checker finds
  calls outside lexical `unsafe(ffi)`. Default driver severity remains advisory;
  only Critical/Verified deny.
- `raw_sffi_call` remains `allow` in the default lint profile. The declaration
  and call-site ratchets freeze debt but do not verify contracts.
- The audit-only HIR inventory carries no artifact/signature evidence and cannot
  establish production admission.

## Current dynamic-provider boundary

- `ExactArtifactDynLib` provides a Linux immutable snapshot and exact digest.
- `SffiAdmissionReceiptV1` parses bounded canonical text but performs no
  cryptography and is source-forgeable.
- Evidence-bound identity checking compares provider, target, artifact, ABI
  registry, and source-signature closure, then atomically resolves cached i64
  slots. It has no production caller and does not validate loader authority.
- The standalone evidence-admission audit verifies Ed25519 trust, exact inputs,
  ABI closure, artifact symbols, and verification receipts. No compiler/runtime
  loader invokes it.
- Rust `NativeLibManager` and raw `spl_dlopen` load providers without that
  evidence gate. Production Simple callers likewise bypass manifests.
- `FfiManifest.validate_library` checks only symbol presence; it does not prove
  ABI, nullability, ownership, or signing. Its stronger cached resolvers are
  currently unused.

## Ownership and memory findings

`std.sffi.dynamic` is the canonical no-GC synchronous owner and compatibility
modules should export it. `ffi/dynamic_versioned.spl` duplicates the canonical
implementation instead of acting as a facade. `MultiVersionLoader` and
`DynLoader` retain process-global maps without eviction, so provider handles and
path text can remain live indefinitely.

Legacy dynamic calls perform per-call symbol lookup; checked integer transport
also allocates a two-element result array. Cached resolved slots remove repeated
lookup, but remain an unsafe migration ABI restricted to `i64(i64...)`.

## Performance invariant

Admission must be one-time:

```text
immutable artifact snapshot -> hash/signature/trust/ABI/receipt checks
    -> resolve complete symbol closure -> atomically publish cached typed slots
```

No admitted hot call may add hashing, signature verification, filesystem work,
path search, string lookup, dictionary lookup, generic decoding, mutex traffic,
or allocation. Required status/null/descriptor checks remain enabled.

## Statistics contract

Every future count must record tree ID, scanner identity, executable identity,
timestamp, exclusions, and exact unit. Keep these units separate:

- declarations;
- distinct symbols;
- live call sites;
- provider modules/families;
- freshly reverified cryptographic admissions.

States are mutually exclusive per row: `admitted_artifact_bound`,
`unsafe_contract_declared`, `unsafe_or_contract_missing`, and
`unknown_uninventoried`. Backed symbols, source claims, saved receipts, fixture
passes, and immutable snapshots are not “verified” or “signed.”

## Research coordination

Read-only sidecars covered compiler enforcement, library/dynload ownership, and
documentation/evidence consistency. `/root` merged and reviewed the findings.
The source-ledger censuses above were run once. The canonical release path
identified itself as the Rust bootstrap seed and the focused baseline spec
failed before execution with the already-recorded `function unsafe not found`
defect (`0.79 s`, `190,448 KiB` peak RSS). Repository policy forbids treating
that seed as self-hosted correctness or optimizer evidence, so the criterion was
not rerun and the implementation slice remains unverified.
