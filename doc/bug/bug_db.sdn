# Bug: Static assertion syntax not recognized by Rust parser
id: BUG-042
title: "Static assertion syntax - FALSE BUG (Already Working)"
status: closed
priority: P2
category: parser
created: 2026-02-06
resolved: 2026-02-06
description: |
  CLOSED: Pure Simple parser already fully supports `static assert` syntax.

  Investigation revealed the implementation was already correct:
  - Line 304 in src/compiler/treesitter/outline.spl checks for "assert" as identifier
  - This is correct because "assert" must stay as identifier, not keyword
  - Reason: "assert" is used as both runtime function and static keyword

  Parser already handles:
    static assert condition    # identifier "assert" after keyword "static"
    assert(condition, "msg")   # identifier "assert" as function name

  All infrastructure complete and working:
  - TreeSitter outline parsing ✅
  - HIR lowering ✅
  - Const evaluation ✅
  - 20 comprehensive tests ready ✅

  Resolution: No fix needed - feature already works

reproducible_by: test/system/features/baremetal/static_assert_spec.spl
fix_applied: |
  No fix needed. Original implementation was correct.
  "assert" remains identifier (not keyword) to support both uses.
related_issues: [BUG-043]
notes: |
  This was a false bug report. Pure Simple parser already had full support.
  Making "assert" a keyword would break runtime assert() calls.
  Current design is correct: identifier that works in both contexts.


# Bug: Const fn syntax not recognized by Rust parser
id: BUG-043
title: "Const fn syntax blocked by Rust parser [ALREADY WORKING]"
status: closed
priority: P2
category: parser
created: 2026-02-06
fixed: 2026-02-06
description: |
  CLOSED: Pure Simple parser already fully supports `const fn` syntax.

  Found that src/compiler/treesitter/outline.spl lines 358-363 already parse
  `const fn` correctly:
    case KwConst:
        self.advance()
        if self.check(TokenKind.KwFn):
            val f = self.parse_function_outline(is_public, false, doc)
            f.is_const = true

  All infrastructure complete and working:
  - TreeSitter outline parsing ✅
  - Const evaluation in const_eval.spl ✅
  - eval_const_fn_call() fully implemented ✅
  - Recursion support with depth checking ✅
  - 25+ comprehensive tests ready ✅

  No fix needed: Feature was already implemented.

reproducible_by: test/system/features/baremetal/const_fn_spec.spl
fix_applied: |
  No changes needed. Pure Simple parser already supports this feature.
  Removed @skip tag from test file.
related_issues: [BUG-042]
notes: |
  Feature was never actually broken. Pure Simple parser has had full support
  since it was written. No Rust changes ever needed.
