# Async Runtime
#
# Futures, actors, and generators with Erlang-inspired optimizations.
#
# Key components:
# - actors: Basic actor spawning/messaging
# - actor_heap: Per-actor heap isolation (Erlang-style GC)
# - mailbox: Off-heap message queues
# - actor_scheduler: Reductions-based fair scheduling
