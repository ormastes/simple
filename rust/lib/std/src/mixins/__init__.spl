# Mixins - Stateful trait composition
#
# Mixins provide reusable fields and methods that can be composed into classes.
# Unlike traits (which define behavioral contracts for runtime dispatch),
# mixins inject state and behavior at definition time.
#
# dyn Mixin is NOT supported because mixins are structural composition,
# not behavioral interfaces. After composition, the class owns the fields
# directly - there is no runtime indirection needed.
