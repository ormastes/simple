# Coverage Module
# Provides data structures for code coverage analysis and runtime FFI
#
# Supported Coverage Metrics:
# - Decision Coverage: Track if each decision (if/while/match) evaluates to both true and false
# - Condition Coverage: Track if each condition within a decision evaluates to both true and false
# - MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage): Track if each condition independently affects the decision
# - Path Coverage: Track which execution paths through functions are taken

# In native mode, the tooling/coverage.spl module provides FFI bindings.
