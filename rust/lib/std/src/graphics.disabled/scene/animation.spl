# Skeletal Animation - Bone-based character animation
#
# Implements hierarchical skeleton system with skinned mesh rendering:
# - Skeleton with joint hierarchy
# - Animation clips with keyframes
# - Linear interpolation (LERP) and spherical interpolation (SLERP)
# - Skinning with vertex weights (up to 4 bones per vertex)
# - Animation blending
# - Inverse kinematics (IK) chains
#
# Based on: doc/spec/graphics_3d.md (Part 4.4: Skeletal Animation)
