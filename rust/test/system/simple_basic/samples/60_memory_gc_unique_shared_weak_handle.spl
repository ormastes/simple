# 60_memory_gc_unique_shared_weak_handle.spl - Pointer kinds (IMPLEMENTED)
#
# Pointer kind infrastructure is implemented:
# - GC-managed (default) - Garbage collected heap objects
# - unique - Register/unregister_unique_root for owned pointers
# - shared - Register/unregister_shared_root for reference-counted pointers
#
# See: src/rust/runtime/src/memory/gc.rs
#
# Note: Language-level syntax for explicit pointer kinds is planned.
# Currently all heap objects use GC (implicit reference counting).

class Player:
    name: str
    hp: i32

# GC-managed (default) - automatically garbage collected
val p: Player = Player { name: "Hero", hp: 100 }
print "gc player created"

# Reference alias - both p and q point to same object
val q = p
print "reference alias"

# Demonstrate object sharing
q.hp = 90  # Would modify shared object (if mutability allowed)
print "Player HP: {p.hp}"

main = p.hp
