# Trait Alias Forwarding

**Feature ID:** #TRAIT-001 | **Category:** Language | **Status:** Active

_Source: `test/feature/usage/trait_forwarding_spec.spl`_

---

## Overview

Tests the delegation pattern generated by the desugar pass from `alias TraitName
= field_name` inside class bodies. Validates immutable and mutable method
forwarding to fields, forwarding to multiple different fields, argument
forwarding, state preservation across mutable calls, correct return values
through forwarding chains, coexistence with own methods, and mixed
mutable/immutable forwarding.

## Syntax

```simple
class Wrapper:
    inner: Inner
    alias Readable = inner
    # desugar generates: fn get_data(): self.inner.get_data()
```

## Test Structure

### Trait Alias Forwarding (Phase 3)

- ✅ delegates immutable method to field
- ✅ delegates mutable method to field
- ✅ forwards to multiple different fields
- ✅ forwards methods that take arguments
- ✅ preserves state across mutable forwarding calls
- ✅ returns correct values through forwarding chain
- ✅ forwarding works alongside own methods
- ✅ forwarding with mixed mutable and immutable methods
