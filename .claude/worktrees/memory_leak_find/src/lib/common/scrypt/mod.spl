# Scrypt Password Hashing Utilities Module (Facade)
#
# Comprehensive scrypt key derivation function implementation for password hashing
# and key derivation. Scrypt is a memory-hard key derivation function designed to
# be resistant to hardware brute-force attacks (ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs).
#
# ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
# scrypt combines three components:
# 1. PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: Key expansion and final derivation
# 2. Salsa20/8 core: Fast mixing function for memory access
# 3. ROMix: Memory-hard function requiring large memory space
#
# SECURITY PROPERTIES:
# - Memory-hard: Requires proportional time AND space
# - Sequential memory-hard: Cannot trade time for space
# - Resistant to ASICs, GPUs, and FPGAs
# - Better than bcrypt and PBKDF2 for password hashing
# - Configurable cost parameters (N, r, p)
