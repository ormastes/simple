# Linked List Types Module
#
# Type definitions for linked list operations.
# Linked lists use tuple representation: (value, next) for singly linked lists
# and (value, prev, next) for doubly linked lists.

# Note: No explicit types defined - linked lists are structural tuples
# Singly linked list node: (value, next)
# Doubly linked list node: (value, prev, next)
# Empty list: nil
