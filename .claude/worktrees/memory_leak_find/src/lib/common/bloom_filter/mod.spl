# Bloom Filter Probabilistic Data Structure Utilities
#
# Comprehensive Bloom filter implementation and related probabilistic data structures
# for efficient set membership testing with configurable false positive rates.
#
# Features:
# - Standard Bloom filters with optimal sizing
# - Counting Bloom filters (support deletion)
# - Scalable Bloom filters (dynamic growth)
# - Cuckoo filters (space-efficient with deletion)
# - Multiple hash functions (FNV, Murmur, DJB2)
# - Bit manipulation utilities
# - Union/intersection operations
# - Serialization support
#
# Bloom Filter Properties:
# - Space efficient probabilistic data structure
# - No false negatives (if not in filter, definitely not in set)
# - Possible false positives (if in filter, might be in set)
# - Cannot delete items (use counting filter for deletion)
# - Optimal parameters: m = -n*ln(p)/(ln(2)^2), k = (m/n)*ln(2)
#   where n = items, p = error rate, m = bits, k = hash functions
