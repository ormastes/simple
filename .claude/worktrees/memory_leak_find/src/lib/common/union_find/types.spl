# Union-Find Type Definitions and Constants
#
# UnionFind structure: (parent: array, rank: array, size: array, count: i64)
# - parent[i]: parent of element i (or i if root)
# - rank[i]: approximate depth of tree rooted at i
# - size[i]: number of elements in set rooted at i
# - count: number of disjoint sets
#
# WeightedUnionFind structure: (parent, rank, size, weight, count)
# - weight[i]: relative weight/distance from parent

# No type constants needed - using tuple representation
