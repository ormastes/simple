# Union-Find (Disjoint Set) Utilities
#
# Efficient data structure for tracking disjoint sets with union and find operations.
# Pure Simple implementation - no external dependencies.
#
# The Union-Find (also called Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure maintains
# a collection of non-overlapping sets. It supports two main operations:
# - find: Determine which set an element belongs to
# - union: Merge two sets into one
#
# Optimizations:
# - Path compression: During find, flatten tree to reduce future lookups
# - Union by rank/size: Merge smaller tree under larger to keep trees shallow
#
# Representation:
# UnionFind = (parent: array, rank: array, size: array, count: i64)
# - parent[i]: parent of element i (or i if root)
# - rank[i]: approximate depth of tree rooted at i
# - size[i]: number of elements in set rooted at i
# - count: number of disjoint sets
#
# Functions:
# - Core: uf_create, uf_find, uf_union, uf_connected
# - Queries: uf_count_sets, uf_set_size, uf_all_sets, uf_representatives
# - Applications: connected_components, is_tree_check, detect_cycle_edges
# - Kruskal MST: kruskal_mst, kruskal_mst_cost
# - Utilities: uf_reset, uf_merge_sets, uf_compress_all
