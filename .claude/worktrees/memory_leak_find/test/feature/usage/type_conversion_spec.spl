# Automatic Type Annotation Conversion

**Feature ID:** #LANG-007
**Category:** Language
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

Type annotation conversion allows a value to be automatically converted to a specified
target type when the annotation differs from the literal form. For example, declaring
`val arr: ArrayList = [1, 2, 3]` would implicitly convert the array literal into an
`ArrayList` instance. This feature is currently deferred, so the spec validates the
baseline behavior: arrays work correctly without explicit type conversion annotations,
ensuring that the standard array literal syntax remains functional as the foundation
for future auto-conversion support.

## Syntax

```simple
val arr = [1, 2, 3]
expect arr.len() == 3
expect arr[0] == 1
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Type Annotation | A declared type on a binding, e.g., `val x: SomeType = value` |
| Auto-Conversion | Planned implicit conversion of a literal to match its declared type |
| Array Literal | The `[1, 2, 3]` syntax that creates a default array without annotation |
| Deferred Status | Feature is designed but not yet implemented; spec guards baseline behavior |
