  DOCUMENTATION

Full documentation:
  - Quick reference:  CLAUDE.md
  - Build guide:      doc/guide/BUILD.md
  - Testing guide:    doc/guide/container_testing.md
  - Commands:         bin/simple --help

  WHY THE CHANGE?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The Simple language project now uses its own build system written
in Simple, demonstrating self-hosting capabilities. This provides:

  ✓ Better integration with the Simple ecosystem
  ✓ More powerful build features
  ✓ Consistent cross-platform behavior
  ✓ Self-hosting demonstration
  ✓ Easier maintenance

The Make-based build system was 989 lines of shell commands that
duplicated functionality now available in the native build system.
