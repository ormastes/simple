## Overview

High-level description of the feature and its purpose.
Explain what problem it solves and why it matters.

## Syntax

```simple
# Example code showing the feature syntax
val example = feature_example()
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Term1   | Explanation of key term |
| Term2   | Explanation of another term |

## Behavior
